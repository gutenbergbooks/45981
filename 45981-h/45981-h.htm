selected as proper subjects to represent the passion of despair.' The old maid,
who is far from an attractive example of her tribe, is looking venom and acerbity
personified. The old bachelor is also of a flinty aspect, his hands are clasped,
thumbs pressed together, and head and eyes uplifted in pious abstraction and
contemplation.</p>

<p><i>February 14, 1800.</i> <cite>Beef &agrave; la Mode.</cite> Published by R. Ackermann, 101
Strand. Etched by Rowlandson (companion to <cite>Collar'd Pork</cite>).&mdash;A veritable
bovine specimen, a fine Alderney, dressed out in the reigning mode. The fore
part in female guise, on the head a gigantic hat of the cart-wheel order, straw
trimmed and garnished, huge ear-rings, the extensive muslin 'choker,' a miniature
of a bull round the cow's neck, ladies' buckled shoes, and ribboned sandles
on the fore legs, and maccaroni's hessians and tassels on the hind ones; a lady's
shawl thrown over the shoulders, according to the fashionable costume worn at
the end of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p><i>March 6, 1800.</i> <a href="#DR_BOTH"><cite>Dr. Botherum, the Mountebank.</cite></a>&mdash;From the bustle and life
visible on all sides it would seem that the period is fair-time, when the rustics
and agricultural population of the vicinity in general flock into the town, holiday-making.
A travelling mountebank has established his theatre in the market place;
the person of the ingenious charlatan is decked out in a fine court dress, with
bag wig, powder, sword, and laced hat complete, the better to excite the respect
of his audience; he is holding forth on the marvellous properties ascribed to the
nostrums which he is seeking to palm off on the simple villagers as wonder-working
elixirs; while his attendants, Merry Andrew and Jack Pudding, are
going through their share of the performance. One branch of the mountebank
physician's profession was the drawing of teeth; an unfortunate sufferer is submitting
himself to the hands of the empiric's assistant. The rural audience is
stolidly contemplating the antics of the party, without being particularly moved
by Dr. Botherum's imposing eloquence, these vagabond scamps being frequently
clever rogues, blessed with an inexhaustible fund of bewildering oratory, and
witty repartee at glib command. Leaving the quack, we find plentiful and
suggestive materials to employ the humourist's skilful graver scattered around.
In the centre, a scene of jealousy is displayed; the beguilements of a portly
butcher are prevailing against the assumed privileges of a slip-shod tailor, who is
seemingly tempted to have recourse to his sheers, to cut the amorous entanglement
summarily asunder. On the left, the promiscuous and greedy feeding
associated with 'fairings,' is going busily forward, and on the opposite side are
exhibited all the drolleries which can be got out of a Jew pedlar, his pack, the
diversified actions of customers he is trying to tempt with his wares, and the
bargains for finery into which the fair and softer sex are vainly trying to beguile
the cunning Hebrew on their own accounts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_5" id="Page_ii_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems probable that Rowlandson in his print of <cite>Doctor Botherum</cite> may
have had a certain Doctor Bossy in his eye, a German practitioner of considerable
skill, who enjoyed a comfortable private practice, said to have been the last
of the respectable charlatans who exhibited in the British metropolis. This
benevolent empiric, as Angelo informs us, dispensed medicines and practised the
healing art, publicly and gratuitously on a stage, his booth being erected weekly
in the midst of Covent-Garden Market, where the mountebank, handsomely
dressed and wearing a gold-laced cocked hat, arrived in his chariot with a
liveried servant behind.</p>

<p>According to the old custom, the itinerant quack doctor, with his attendant
gang, was as constant a visitor at every market-place as the pedlar with his
pack.</p>

<p><i>March 12, 1800.</i> <cite>Humbugging, or Raising the Devil.</cite> Published by R.
Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;A credulous personage, who, judging from his costume,
is in a fair position in life, has called to consult a necromancer. The enchanter has
a venerable beard, and a divining rod; according to usage, he has made a circle
of skulls, toads, and other inviting objects, in the centre of which, through a
stage trap, he is raising the 'very deil,' and has conjured up a pantomimic
demon, horned, winged, and grotesquely arranged, holding in one hand a gore-stained
dagger, and a goblet of suppositious blood in the other. The knees of
the befooled spectator are trembling beneath him; his back is turned to a curtain
which conceals a fair enchantress, who is assisting the invocation, and giving a
practical turn to the delusion by removing a well-filled pocket-book from the
coat-tail of the simple victim. In the background is the traditional whiskered
cat, and the folio of cabalistic signs; a stuffed crocodile is suspended from the
roof.</p>

<p><i>March 12, 1800.</i> <cite>Hocus Pocus, or Searching for the Philosopher's Stone.</cite>
Rowlandson del. and sculp. Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;Companion
plate to 'Humbugging, or raising the Devil.' The artist introduces us
to the laboratory of a so-called alchemist. A roguish Jew and his familiar are
busily engaged in the transmutation of metals; the servant, with a pair of long-nozzled
bellows, is engaged in kindling the furnace, in which is a crucible;
various retorts, alembics, and other paraphernalia of the 'black arts,' are
scattered about, as well as a formula for 'changing lead into gold;' although
the alchemists at best could only contrive to accomplish the reverse transmutation.
Suggestive prints are hung on the walls of this chamber of mystery, such
as the portrait of the notorious 'Count Cagliostro, discoverer of the Philosopher's
Stone,' and the figure of the spurious 'Bottle Conjurer.'</p>

<p>A military officer, in the next apartment, is turning his opportunities to more
practical advantage by embracing, with a certain display of ardour, a pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_6" id="Page_ii_6">[6]</a></span>
maiden&mdash;who is nothing loth,&mdash;the daughter, it appears, of the philosophically
minded investigator.</p>

on the pillar of Fortitude, Britannia's shield is outstretched for his protection, and
her spear is striking at the would-be assassin Hadfield, who, wearing a repellant
expression, is slinking down before her: his pistol has fallen from his hand; round
his neck is a halter, with the end of which a miniature edition of the Evil One is
flying off, crying: 'Hadfield, for thy diabolical attempt thou shalt meet with thy

ill-favoured old maid, who is evidently a person of fortune, is seated on her sofa
between two admirers, a clergyman and a military officer, who are respectively
ambitious of the honour of her hand. Her old-maidish tastes are indicated by
the nature of her pets; a monkey, seated in the embrasure of the window, is
scratching his ear; he is supported on the opposite side by a parrot, which is
screaming with the full force of its lungs.</p>

but dares not venture to move for fear of arousing the attention of her

who, all impatience, is looking over the shoulders of his messenger.</p>

<p><i>August 20, 1800.</i> <a href="#SUMMER_AMUSE"><cite>Summer Amusement; or, a Game at Bowls.</cite></a> Published
by T. Rowlandson, 1 James's Street, Adelphi.&mdash;It has been a custom immemorial
to laugh at the exertions which were made by our ancestors to obtain rational
open-air recreation. The fashionable part of society have, for once, found congenial
allies in the wits. The papers which doubtless obtained the most popular reception
in their day, since they laughed at the simple citizens 'on pleasure bent,' and held
up their relaxations to a ridicule which was often neither subtle nor polished, were
the essays in the <cite>Spectator</cite>, <cite>Tatler</cite>, <cite>Guardian</cite>, <cite>Humourist</cite>, <em>&amp;c.</em>, which made fun
of the countrified loungings of the Londoners. The squibs, in the shape of
poetical broadsheets and songs of the Stuart era, against sylvan aspirations, were
but re-echoed by the bright and cultivated humourists who flourished when
'Anna ruled the realm.' Sturdy Hogarth, with his pictures, brought the commonplace
pleasures&mdash;although he was addicted to them with no half-spirit himself&mdash;of
his neighbours into ludicrous prominence. The <cite>Connoisseur</cite>, <cite>World</cite>,
<cite>Mirror</cite>, <cite>Adventurer</cite>, <cite>Observer</cite>, <cite>Lounger</cite>, <cite>Looker-on</cite>, and even Johnson's <cite>Rambler</cite>,
are particularly caustic on the comic side of humanity, as seen in their
out-of-door pastimes. As to the days of transition, when the early Georgian
generation was being rapidly submerged and effaced by the tide of progression,
both writers and caricaturists combined to satirise cockney jauntings unmercifully.
Gillray, Rowlandson, Collings, Boyle, Bunbury, Deighton, Woodward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_8" id="Page_ii_8">[8]</a></span>
Nixon, Newton, and a swarm of amateur followers, were always ready to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_9" id="Page_ii_9">[9]</a></span>
fun of suburban excursions; such productions were certain to obtain fame for
the designers, and a ready patronage at the hands of a public which encouraged
similar everyday irony.</p>

<p>It seems, however, now the suburbs have disappeared, where tea-gardens were
once abundant&mdash;to which, armed with lanterns and in groups, for better security
against the knights of the road, footpads, and similar dangers which were then
rife, our forefathers repaired with light hearts, released from the culture of
Mammon and money-grubbing&mdash;that we have lost a great deal which modern
improvements are powerless to restore.</p>

<p>A little generation back there were still relics of past pleasure haunts, a
Sluice House, a Hornsey Wood House, and numberless similar resorts for
the dwellers in Babylon, who sighed to turn, for a brief afternoon of diversion,
their respectable backs on groves of brick, and to regale their pastoral-longing
eyes with a semblance of the country. Now the monster metropolis,
with unsparing strides, has finally absorbed such patches of verdure, as made
homely retreats on red-letter holidays; and life is considerably restricted,
as regards the variety which an hour's jaunt could introduce into the prosaic
current of yearly existence, as far as the boundaries of the giant city are concerned.</p>

<p>A great deal could be written on the defunct pleasure-gardens which once enlivened
the outskirts; but their glories are departed, or at best preserved in the
satires, literary and artistic, which contemporary humourists levelled at the Georgic-loving
citizens who frequented them. Such a suburban retreat, with the motley
crowds who disported themselves thereat, is graphically reproduced in Rowlandson's
plate of <a href="#SUMMER_AMUSE"><cite>Summer Amusement</cite></a>. Much of the delight was prosaic and toilsome;
but, seemingly, good fun was to be had, and people could lay aside their conventional
rigidity for once and awhile, when fine weather and the pleasant season
tempted them to stray, and leave the everlasting counting-house at home, for
a game at bowls and a little wholesome relaxation. The various groups found
in the picture are well conceived. Two games are proceeding, into which cits,
of various degrees, are throwing their entire energies. The whimsical accompaniments
connected with 'taking tea in the arbour' are faithfully seized. The
soberer elders are crowding the hospitable 'house of call.' Round the foremost
table is gathered a convivial party; the worthy souls are draining a parting bowl,
before commencing their return journey, for which the lantern is set on the
ground in prudent preparation. A little toasting is going on at the next table, and
beyond that an arcadian flirtation is in progress, with various incidents transpiring
around, such as the observant philosopher might have noted in 1800, without
travelling very far out of his way.</p>

<p>1800. <cite>Yorick feeling the Grisette's Pulse.</cite> 8vo.&mdash;The interior of the
Grisette's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Magasin des Modes</i>. The plate is delicately etched. Yorick is seated
beside the pretty milliner; the complaisant husband is bowing, grimacing, and
attitudinising. A poodle is on a settee. Two blocks, hat and cap moulds, are,
with bandboxes, robes, &amp;c., scattered around. Outside is seen a glimpse of the
quaint antiquated French street life, such as might be encountered by the sentimental
traveller before the Revolution:&mdash;priests, monks, portresses, &amp;c., with
images of saints at the street corners.</p>

<p>On August 15, 1800, Mr. Ackermann issued at his Repository of Arts, 101
Strand, a series of six plates designed and etched in Rowlandson's boldest and most
spirited style; and finished and coloured in almost exact imitation of the original
drawings. Each plate contains three large distinct heads, festooned with attributes
peculiar to the respective designs. It is not very clear whether these symbolical
groupings, which are superior in execution to the average of Rowlandson's published
works, were devised to be cut up for scrap-books, screens, or wall borderings;
but they have become remarkably scarce since the date of publication, and sets of
these typical heads (eighteen in all) are rarely met with at the present date.</p>

<p><cite>Philosophorum.</cite>&mdash;The head of the philosopher closely resembles the conventional
portrait accorded to Father Time, horn spectacles, forelock, grey beard
and all. The globe, a sextant, mariner's compass, chart, telescope, dividers, bells,
squares, thermometers, &amp;c., make up the symbolical garland which depends
from the ears of this emblem of knowledge.</p>

<p><cite>Fancynina.</cite>&mdash;This figure is borne out by one of the artist's favourite types
of female beauty, a well-featured, handsomely made and languishing-looking
young lady, wearing a modish hat, all feathered, beaded, and flowered. The
portrait of <em>Fancynina</em> is festooned with such emblems of feminine frivolity as
French rouge, Court sticking-plaister (for patches), ottar of roses, watches and
trinkets, miniatures of admirers, an opera glass, a black domino or half-mask, a
huge muff, parasol, fan, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_11" id="Page_ii_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><cite>Epicurum.</cite>&mdash;An old gourmand in a red nightcap, whose flushed and blossoming
countenance appears through a goodly string of sausages; a gridiron, a basting
ladle, a cucumber, and other indications of creature comforts complete the
emblems of this figure.</p>

<p><cite>Penserosa.</cite>&mdash;The head of a tragic performer, modelled on that of one of the
Gorgones is used to illustrate this figure. The Medusa head is entwined with
serpents, and wreathed below with a festoon of bays, beneath which hang the
dagger and bowl, and the manuscript of <em>Penserosa's</em> tragic part.</p>

<p><cite>Tally ho! rum!</cite>&mdash;The head of a Nimrod, backed with a huntsman's
cap, is the sign-piece of this figure; a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corne de chasse</i> is hung round the
sportsman's neck, and on it are spurs, horseshoes, whips, a gun, powder-flask,
and game bag; a fox's head completes the group of emblems distinctive of <cite>Tally
ho! rum!</cite></p>

<p><cite>Allegoria.</cite>&mdash;The head of a rubicund, but young and well-featured, Bacchus
does duty for <em>Allegoria</em>; heavy clusters of vine-leaves, and bunches of purple
grapes and tendrils crown and surround the bucolic divinity; below is a Silenus
mask; bacchanalian flutes, and pipes of Pan, complete the insignia.</p>

<p><cite>Physicorum.</cite>&mdash;The face of a lean, high-dried, and sharp-featured doctor, with
a high, white wig, and a profusion of horsehair curls, figures forth <em>Physicorum</em>
with proper character; festoons of bottles of medicine, soporific, strengthening,
emollient, purging and sleeping draughts in all varieties, boxes of pills, ointments,
drops, prescriptive puffs, quackeries, and the inevitable syringe and clyster pipe,
make up the attributes of the physician.</p>

<p><cite>Nunina.</cite>&mdash;The head of a rosy-cheeked and buxom Nun, her eyes devoutly
raised to realms above. Beneath the portrait the crowned and ghastly skull of
King Death, a book of devotions, a <em>flagellum</em> for discipline, a crucifix, hour-glass
and rosary, and other pious symbols are displayed.</p>

<p><cite>Publicorum.</cite>&mdash;The face of a fat and rubicund-visaged landlord does duty as
the emblem of <em>Publicorum</em>; as may be supposed, the symbols of this personage
consist mainly of convivial attributes&mdash;tobacco-boxes, pipes, bottles of rum,
brandy, and rack; a tankard, limes, lemons, a punchbowl, ladle, &amp;c.</p>

<p><cite>Funeralorum.</cite>&mdash;The head of a professional mourner, with long crape
streamers round his hat, and a mourning cloak. <em>Funeralorum</em> is surrounded by
such cheerful attributes as funeral sermons, advertisements of interments, and
invitations to the same, burial fees, titles, last wills and testaments, hatchments,
Yorick's skull, an hour-glass, and a sexton's pick and spade.</p>

<p><cite>Virginia.</cite>&mdash;The head of a soured and malignant-looking old maid, whose
favourite parrot is screaming in her ear. The vixenish face is festooned with
suppositious attributes of old spinsterhood&mdash;a group of boxes of snuff, corn-plaisters,
padlocks, pincushions, cats-meat, anonymous letters, drops for the colic;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_12" id="Page_ii_12">[12]</a></span>
while a bag for 'winnings at <em>quadrille</em>' is displayed on the <cite>Scandalous Magazine</cite>,
beside which are perched two spitting and caterwauling old tom-cats.</p>

<p><cite>Hazardorum.</cite>&mdash;The head given as representative of <em>Hazardorum</em> wears a
very disconsolate and downcast look; fortune has not favoured the gambler,
as is figuratively evinced by a purse turned upside down, from which the
contents are escaping, mortgage-deeds, annuity bonds, <em>Hoyle on Chances</em>, a
betting book, a game cock, rackets, dice and a dice-box. <em>The Racing Calendar</em>,
playing cards, billiard cues, a loaded pistol, and other suggestive emblems supply
the features of <em>Hazardorum</em>.</p>

<p><cite>Battlcorum.</cite>&mdash;The head of a fierce-looking warrior, with plumed hat, sets
forth <em>Battlcorum</em>; warlike attributes surround the stern hero, whose face is grim
as war itself. Chain-shot, pistols, shot-belts, a cartouche box, bayonet, sword,
gun, drum. &amp;c., help out the martial figure and assist its due signification.</p>

<p><cite>Billingsgatina</cite> displays the face of a buxom young fish-girl, topped with a
sailor's straw hat, and surrounded by evidences of her fishy profession: strings
of eels, lobsters, crabs, cod, oysters, and fish-baskets are introduced to support
the character of <em>Billingsgatina</em>.</p>

<p><cite>Trafficorum</cite> is represented by a long-haired, hook-nosed, shrewd-eyed Jew
pedlar, wearing an unkempt beard; round his neck hangs the suggestive hawker's
box, with the multifarious contents of the pack displayed; scissors, tape, ribands,
spectacles, purses, razors, combs, knives, forks and spoons, watches, trinkets,
necklaces, ear-rings, buckles, and an infinity of similar articles, disclose the
identity of <em>Trafficorum</em>.</p>

<p><cite>Barberorum.</cite>&mdash;The head of a French hair-dresser does duty for this figure;
a comb is stuck in the lengthy locks, and a white apron is pinned under the
shaven chin. Implements properly pertaining to the barber's calling are introduced
to form a trophy; a string of wigs of all colours and shapes, a block, powder-bags,
curling-irons, tongs, combs, scissors, tooth brushes, razors and Packwood's
strops, flasks of scent, eau de Luce, lotions, boxes of pommades, rouge, &amp;c.,
furnish forth emblemata of the hair-dressing <em>Barberorum</em>.</p>

<p><cite>Flora</cite> is represented by a sweetly innocent flower-seller, whose soft and
winning face appears above clusters of roses, lilies, tulips, bluebells, and other
flowers, while beneath the attributes of <em>Flora</em> are completed by a basket of fruits
and vegetables.</p>

<p><cite>Lawyerorum</cite> very significantly closes the series of emblematical heads. The
counsel is a hard-featured, sharp, close, shrewd, and long-headed looking individual,
attired in his horsehair wig, and festooned around with the sweets of his
profession&mdash;<em>Affidavits</em>, <em>Subp&oelig;n&aelig;</em>, <em>Perjuries</em>, <em>Bankrupts enlarged</em>, '<em>Wills made
on the shortest notice</em>,' <em>Writs of Error</em>, <em>Clausum Friget</em>, <em>Bills of Costs</em>, <em>Declarations</em>,
<em>Actions between John Doe and Richard Roe</em>, <em>Warrants for assaults</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_13" id="Page_ii_13">[13]</a></span>
<em>Habeas Corpus</em>, <em>Suits in Chancery</em>, <em>Lists of Informations</em>, <em>Quirks</em>, <em>Quibbles</em>,
<em>Briefs</em>, <em>Title-deeds</em>, <em>Statutes at large</em>, bags of <em>causes</em>, ponderous legal volumes;
the emblemata are significantly supported by a well-filled brief bag, plethoric
with 'cash received on clients' accounts, not paid over.'</p>

of a landed proprietor; mine host wears a red nightcap, and clean white sleeves,
apron, and stockings. Tony Lumkin has been trying to palm off an old story on

family party sitting down to the diurnal repast. The head of the house is
an ill-favoured person, of advanced age and wearing a tremendous wig. Before
him is a leg of mutton, and, knife and fork in hand, he is considering the joint with
the eye of disfavour. 'It's red!' he grumbles, 'not fit to eat!&mdash;these are the
blessed effects of boiling mutton in a cloth!' His wife is regarding the dinner with
consternation; one son is opening his eyes, and 'making a mouth' apprehensive
of losing his dinner; another youth bears a look of absolute dejection; the
family circle is completed by the addition of a queer poodle, seated on his hind
legs, and wearing a disappointed look, like the rest of the diners. An appropriate
pair of figures, <em>Peace</em> and <em>Concord</em>, are hung on the wall by way of pictures.</p>

and somewhat decrepit spouse has been for a 'constitutional.' On his return
he is gratified with the discovery of a very interesting domestic tableau: his young
and pretty wife is fast asleep on the knee of a dashing officer, who, seated on the
family sofa, is also slumbering blissfully, with one arm round the waist of the
faithless wife, while his hand is clasping that of the lady, one of whose arms
tenderly encircles the neck of her martial admirer. The rash intruder on this
scene, with good reason, is much shocked at the situation, and is exclaiming in
dismay, 'My wife! as sure as I am a haberdasher.'</p>

<p>1800. <cite>Matrimonial Comforts.</cite> No. 5, <em>Killing with Kindness</em>. Woodward
del. Etched by Rowlandson. Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;The
victim to ill-directed matrimonial attentions is a stout countrified old gentleman;
he is seated in his arm-chair, very much at the mercy of two fair and youthful
tormentors, whose exertions on his behalf are probably <em>not</em> disinterested. The
wife, a very stylish damsel, seemingly young enough to be the daughter of her
embarrassed spouse, is leaning on his chair and pressing him to partake of a
dish of fruit, and insisting, 'You must have some apricots, my love!' while her
sister, patting the husband affectionately on the shoulder, is forcing a bunch of
grapes into his mouth, which he has incautiously opened, to express his dissent:
'Just take these grapes, brother-in-law, you never eat finer!' The old gentleman,
who shrewdly values this devotion at its worth, is crying: 'I wo'nt eat
anything more, I tell you&mdash;I shall be choked&mdash;got an eye to the estate, I
suppose!'</p>

tailor, with measuring-tape on shoulder and shears in pocket, has brought home a
new suit, into which an ill-made and clumsy-looking personage has, with some difficulty,
managed to thrust his limbs. The coat is that very unbecoming garment,
fashionable at the date of the etching, and known as a <em>Jean de Brie</em>&mdash;a close-fitting,
swallow-tailed garment, with a hump-like high collar, and sleeves tight to
the shoulders, which were distended by a gouty puff, giving a generally distorted
appearance to the back of the wearer. The victim is contemplating his uncomfortable
suit in a looking-glass held by the tailor, who is dismayed at the indignant
protest of his client: 'Why, you have put me a hump upon each shoulder,
and here's a pair of Dutchman's breeches that would hold provision for a
marching regiment; well, I tell you what, Master Tailor, d&mdash;&mdash; me if I would
go to our club such a figure for fifty pounds!' The snip is assuring him in
reply: 'Made entirely to your lady's orders, your Honour, I assure you she

expression, is giving one hand to a cheerful old 'chum' from the
country, and pointing with the disengaged hand to two stout wenches deep
in the washing-tubs: 'Ah! my old friend,' cries the host to the traveller, 'I
wish you had called at some more convenient time, but this is washing day&mdash;I
have nothing to give you but cold fish, cold tripe, and cold potatoes, you may
smell soapsuds a mile! Ah Jack! Jack! you don't know these Comforts! You

of injured martyrdom, has clasped his hands in despair of obtaining rest
from the energetic denunciations of his wife, who, leaning over him in a commanding
attitude, is pouring forth her 'Caudle-like' remonstrances over the
prostrate sufferer: 'Yes, you base man, you; don't you eat, drink, and sleep

<p>1800 (?). <cite>Preparation for the Academy, Old Joseph Nollekens and his
Venus.</cite>&mdash;John Thomas Smith, many years Keeper of the prints and drawings
in the British Museum, and better known by his works on metropolitan antiquities,
to which he furnished etchings, as well as arch&aelig;ological researches, has left
us one of the chattiest and most eccentric biographies to be found in the annals of
literature&mdash;the <cite>Life of the Sculptor Nollekens</cite>, whose pupil he was. Much as we
are indebted to 'Antiquity Smith' for the whimsical anecdotes he has imported into
his unequivocally entertaining pair of volumes, which touch freely upon contemporary
men and things under their most familiar and every-day aspect, we cannot fail
to feel a passing regret that the versatile keeper has forgotten to make any anecdotal
mention of his friend Rowlandson, with whom he was on terms of cordiality.
The caricaturist had presented, at times, some of his most interesting drawings
to 'his old friend John Thomas Smith,' as he has taken care to inscribe on the
margins, with his autograph; the best of these is possibly, <cite>Drawing from the
Life-School at the Royal Academy</cite>&mdash;a subject upon which both the humourists were
well informed, since they had worked there as students, and were more or less
acquainted with all the artists of the day, and, moreover, it being impossible to
overlook such points, with their keen sense of the eccentric; they had noted&mdash;the
one with his pencil, and the other with his pen&mdash;all the striking peculiarities, personal
or professional, of their numerous associates. The latest portrait the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_17" id="Page_ii_17">[17]</a></span>
writer has seen of our artist is one drawn with a pen in outline and tinted
with Indian ink by the worthy keeper, one day when the caricaturist was visiting
the Print Room of the British Museum, Rowlandson being, at that time, well
advanced in years. The sketch is that of a large and decisive-looking elderly
gentleman, with a bald head, firmly-cut features, and wearing big old-fashioned
spectacles; this portrait was taken while the subject was stooping to examine a
drawing. Beneath it John Thomas Smith has inscribed the particulars under
which he came to draw the portrait of 'his old friend.'</p>

<p>The grave omission with which we have to charge Nollekens' biographer,
usually so amazingly fertile in individualistic traits of everyone he knew&mdash;and he
seems to have been fairly acquainted with, or to have something amusing to
impart about, nearly everybody of any note&mdash;in respect to the caricaturist, of
whom his writings make no sort of mention, is the more to be regretted, since it
was probably a sly hint imparted by 'Antiquity Smith' which produced the
picture of the gifted old miser at work on one of his cherished subjects&mdash;a whimsical
study, doubtless founded on a special visit of observation, instituted, with
Nollekens' old pupil, for the very purpose. As regards the sculptor's portrait,
which is seemingly caricatured, John Thomas Smith comes in as aptly with his
description<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> as if the two sittings had taken place simultaneously, and the
biographer and artist had worked <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en collaboration</i>:&mdash;'His figure was short, his
head big, and it appeared much increased by a large-crowned hat, of which he
was very fond. His neck was short, his shoulders narrow, his body too large,
particularly in the front lower part; he was bow-legged and hook-nosed; indeed,
his leg was somewhat like his nose, which resembled the rudder of an Antwerp
packet-boat; his lips were rather thin, but between his brows there was great
evidence of study.'</p>

<div class="caption">PREPARATIONS FOR THE ACADEMY. OLD JOSEPH NOLLEKENS AND HIS VENUS.</div>
</div>

<p>As to 'his Venuses' Mrs. Nollekens invariably continued to express the
most derogatory opinions, since she regarded his fair models as 'abandoned
huzzies, with whom she had no patience,' regarding her eccentric spouse as quite
on their level, for she cherished the extraordinary conviction that after his marriage
he ought to have 'dispensed with such people.' While Mrs. Nollekens was
unduly mindful of her husband's favourite models, it seems these ladies, under
altered circumstances, occasionally amused themselves by reminding the sculptor
of their former acquaintance, on which pleasant fact his biographer does not fail
to enlarge, in more than one <span class="locked">instance:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>'Our sculptor would sometimes amuse himself, on a summer's evening, by
standing with his arms behind him at the yard-gate, which opened into Titchfield
Street. During one of these indulgences, as a lady was passing, most elegantly
dressed, attended by a strapping footman in silver-laced livery, with a tall gilt-headed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_18" id="Page_ii_18">[18]</a></span>
cane, she nodded to him, and, smiling, asked him if he did not know her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_19" id="Page_ii_19">[19]</a></span>
On his reply that he did not recollect her, "What, sir!" exclaimed she, "do you
forget Miss Coleman, who brought a letter to you from Charles Townley, to
compare limbs with your Venus? Why, I have been with you twenty times in
that little room, to stand for your Venus." "Oh! <em>lawk-a-daisy</em>, so you have!"
answered Nollekens. "Why, what a fine woman you're grown! Come, walk in,
and I'll show you your figure&mdash;I have done it in marble." After desiring the man
to stop at the gate she went in with him; and upon seeing Mrs. Nollekens at the
parlour-window, who was pretending to talk to and feed her sister's bullfinch, but
who had been informed by the vigilant Bronze (the eccentric maid-servant of this
odd pair) of what had been going on at the gate, she went up to her and said,
"Madam, I have to thank&mdash;&mdash;." Mrs. Nollekens then elevated herself on her
toes, and, with a lisping palpitation, began to address the lady. "Oh, dear,"
observed Miss Coleman, "and you don't know me! You have given me many a
basin of broth in the depth of winter, when I used to stand for Venus." Mrs.
Nollekens, not knowing what to think of Joseph, shook her head at him as she
slammed the window, at the same time exclaiming, "Oh, fie! Mr. Nollekens!
Fie! fie!" Bronze assured me that when her master went into the front parlour
he had a pretty warm reception. "What!" said her mistress, "to know such
wretches after you have done with them in your studio!"'</p>

<p>'The romantic and picturesque scenery of North and South Wales, having
within these few years been considered highly noticeable and attractive, I was
induced to visit this Principality with my friend Mr. Rowlandson, whose abilities
as an artist need no eulogium from me. We left London in August 1797,
highly expectant of gratification: nor were our highest hopes in the least frustrated.</p>

<p>'At the time of our excursion I had no idea of submitting to the public any
of our minutes or sketches; but, as several of the subjects amongst our scenery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_20" id="Page_ii_20">[20]</a></span>
have become topics of admiration, as well to the artist as cursory traveller, I have
in the following sheets endeavoured to give a faint idea of their beauties; accompanied
by some short remarks on the road, merely intended as a sort of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vade mecum</i> to stimulate the readers to further and more important enquiries;
and in order, if possible, that they may, by being apprised of many inconveniences
we experienced, be enabled to avoid them.'</p>

observation, that in spite of the melancholy and frequent carpings, on puritanical
grounds, which are now in fashion, over the growing degeneracy of the times
in which we live&mdash;the sanctimonious being given to assert that each succeeding
generation inveterately surpasses the excesses of its predecessors&mdash;in the instances
of drinking and gaming our ancestors went to extremes beside which our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_24" id="Page_ii_24">[24]</a></span>
modern dissipations, in their wildest excesses, fall into paltry insignificance.
The clubs of the past, in the item of iniquity, although the institution was in
its infancy, surpassed those of the present day in such a degree that our 'fastest'
haunts appear prudish by comparison.</p>

<p>As to <a href="#BRILLIANTS"><cite>The Brilliants</cite></a>, we do not accept the scene, in its literal sense, as a
faithful transcript of current amusements as practised at the commencement of
the century; but, allowing for the exaggeration of burlesque, we are far from
denying that it is founded on actual observation, in an age notoriously given
to conviviality, which was carried, in all phases of society, beyond the bounds of
discretion, and, in some instances, to a decree incredible in our times. Their
Royal Highnesses the Princes of the Blood, their Graces the Dukes, the proverbially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_25" id="Page_ii_25">[25]</a></span>
drunken Lords, the Right Honourable Ministers of State, Honourable Members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_26" id="Page_ii_26">[26]</a></span>
of every political shade, and gallant and learned gentlemen of the various
services and professions, were, with the rest of the community, without mentioning
notorious and personal instances, under no restraint of decorum in regard
to inebriety; and, if we may trust their own chroniclers, exhibited themselves
without reserve as frequently drunk as sober. If, in our charitable concessions to
the failings of our ancestors, we assume that our artist has exercised undue licence
in the representation of their failings, from the president of <em>The Brilliants</em> downwards,
we must further take 'a grain of salt' to qualify our belief in the fidelity
with which he has transmitted us the 'club rules.' It is impossible that any convivialist
could continue to be 'brilliant' after his senses were diluted by the amount
of fluid prescribed as a qualification for membership; the light that was in him
must be effectally extinguished by the vinous drenching that was <span class="locked"><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de rigueur</i>:&mdash;</span></p>

sculp. Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;This large plate,
which is designed with a due appreciation of grim humour and tipsy jocularity,
introduces the traditional relaxations of the funeral furnishers, whose jollifications
are supposed to offer the most ghastly contrast to their sober professional duties.
On a convenient plot of grass mutes, wandsmen, hearse-drivers, and all the
other melancholy functionaries of the last rites of unconscious humanity, are picnicking
with a true zest and appreciation of rural freedom. A substantial pie,
and other suggestive 'funeral baked meats,' are being disposed of to the best
advantage; but, excellent trenchermen though the undertakers may prove themselves,
their main distinction must rest on their bibulous qualities; the members
of the fraternity are applying themselves with hearty goodwill to the fluids, far
on the road to becoming 'glorious,' while some of the party have already reached
their congenial stage 'of half seas over.' These festivities, of course, take place
in the vicinity of a 'house of call for funerals,' at the sign of 'The Owl,' in the
neighbourhood of a burial-ground, the hospitable hostelry being kept by 'Robert
Death,' whose inn is a resting-place for all returning hearses on that particular
road. Groups of gentlemen engaged in the 'black business' are seated at
tables, enjoying their long clay pipes, or otherwise diverting themselves with
romping and horse-play; the members of another party, preparing to resume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_27" id="Page_ii_27">[27]</a></span>
their route back to the metropolis, are on the roof of their hearse, their legs
hanging over the side with pastoral-like simplicity, smoking their 'church-wardens'
and hobnobbing their pewter quart pots with true bacchanalian
appreciation of the enjoyments of the hour. The results of too indiscriminate
indulgence are noticeable in the dangerous situation of those coaches which
are attempting to 'homeward wend their melancholy way,' and are being overturned
in the process by their tipsy drivers.</p>

Piccadilly.&mdash;This subject&mdash;which, to say the least of it, is suggestively bold,
though by no means, in our opinion, coming under the enumeration of 'risky
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">equivoque</i>'&mdash;might be fittingly described as Superstition and Sensuality; the pious
belief, amounting to fanaticism, of the conventual 'Sister' contrasting strongly
with the licentious impiety of the gross priest.</p>

<p><i>January 30, 1801.</i> <cite>Single Combat, in Moorfields, or Magnanimous Paul O!
Challenging All O!</cite> Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;The ring is
formed in Moorfields, crowds of spectators are gathered around, the curious have
climbed up every available point of sight, and observers are scrambling over the
roofs. 'Magnanimous Paul O!' the mad Emperor, is represented as a Russian
bear; his sword is tempered '&agrave; la Suwarrow,' and his shield is inscribed 'Swallow
all O!' The British champion, Pitt, encased in a demi-suit of mail, is jauntily
meeting his adversery; the Minister's sword is tempered '&agrave; la Nelson,' and the
names of his redoubtable admirals, Howe, Duncan, Nelson, Jervis, and Parker,
are the safeguards of his buckler. A Russian general, who is acting as his
master's squire, is reading Paul's extraordinary cartel: 'Be it known to all men,
that my master, the most magnanimous, most puissant, most powerful, and most
wonderful Great Bear of the North, being in his sound and sober senses, challenges
the whole world to single combat, and commences his first trial of skill here,
in Moorfields, after which it is his intention to pursue his travels, and visit every
Court in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America.'</p>

<p>The Emperor Paul, who had acquired almost universal popularity at the
commencement of his reign by putting himself at the head of the allied armies
which were opposing the victorious career of Napoleon, now astonished his
admirers in England by a complete change of policy. He proclaimed himself
Grand Master of Malta, which had been conquered by us in 1800. The British
Government refused to recognise his authority; the Emperor in revenge laid an
embargo upon all British ships in Russian ports, and succeeded in inducing the
Danish, Swedish, and Prussian Courts to enter into a convention to protect their
commerce against the encroachments of the English. Gillray has drawn the
ill-favoured and mad sovereign, under the title '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mens turpe, corpore turpi</i>,'
trampling on the treaty of alliance into which he had entered in concert with
Austria and England.</p>

<p>Some two months after the issue of this caricature the wayward tyranny of
the Emperor, who gave unmistakable evidence of mental aberration, became
insupportable, and he was requested to abdicate. Paul obstinately clung to absolute
power, but in spite of his precautions a conspiracy was organised by his
disgusted nobles, his palace was entered, and he was strangled with his own
military scarf, which, by the way, the satirists always drew of extravagant dimencions
well suited for such a purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_29" id="Page_ii_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be remembered that Paul's career was an unfortunate one, and the vicissitudes
of his youth may have disordered his faculties. On his birth his father,
Peter the Third, issued a ukase denying the legitimacy of his son's paternity: on
the publication of this statement the Empress put her husband to death. Paul's
earlier years were harassed by trouble, and the last act of his mother was a
fruitless effort to exclude him from the succession. His reign commenced
auspiciously; acts of clemency and munificence distinguished his government;
as the head of the alliance against France he was looked upon as the legitimate
champion of monarchy. After sharing the defeats sustained by the allied armies
his views underwent a remarkable change. Buonaparte, with his matchless discrimination,
contrived to flatter the Emperor's vanity, and, among other strokes
of policy, returned all the Russian prisoners, well-armed and newly-clad. Paul
now entered into a defensive alliance with France to drive the English out of
India; and, to destroy our maritime supremacy, he established the Northern
Confederation for the suppression of British commerce.</p>

<p>The caricature <cite>Single Combat in Moorfields</cite> is founded on an extraordinary
proceeding, which filled Europe with astonishment at its unequalled eccentricity.
The Emperor published an advertisement in the <cite>Court Gazette</cite> of St. Petersburg,
stating, to the amazement of the world, that, as 'the Powers could not agree
among themselves, he intended to point out a spot, to which all the other sovereigns
were invited to repair, <span class="smcap">to fight in single combat</span>, bringing with them,
as seconds and esquires, their most enlightened ministers and ablest generals.'
His subjects were continually annoyed by acts of minor and fantastic oppression&mdash;such
as an edict against 'round hats and pantaloons,' which he forbade any
person to wear in his empire. He enforced the revival of hair-powder and pigtails,
and issued a proclamation to compel all persons whom he encountered in
the street to leave their carriages and prostrate themselves before him. No one
was safe from his paroxysms. The carriage of the British Ambassador passed
the Imperial Palace at a pace which the Emperor chose to consider disrespectful;
he immediately ordered the coachman to be beaten, the horses to be beaten, and
the carriage to be beaten. The Ambassador in return resented these indignities
by discharging his servants, ordering his horses to be shot, and his carriage to
be thrown into the Neva. An insane autocrat was found to be a formidable
calamity.</p>

<p>The favourable reception accorded to <cite>Country Characters</cite>, <cite>Matrimonial
Comforts</cite>, &amp;c., induced Woodward to design further successions of subjects,
enlisting the assistance of Rowlandson to carry out his ideas. In 1801, the
year following, appeared a series of broadsides, <cite>Prayers</cite> and <cite>Journals</cite>; each
sheet contained a coloured illustration, designed by Woodward and etched by
Rowlandson; the space below the design was filled up with descriptive matter from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_30" id="Page_ii_30">[30]</a></span>
Woodward's pen, that worthy being given to the cultivation of the various
Muses in turn. The letterpress, which occupied the larger half of these broadsides,
was printed by E. Spragg, 27 Bow Street, Covent Garden; and the series
was published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand. Our readers will be able to form
an impression of these compositions from the occasional extracts we offer;
these <cite>Prayers</cite>, <cite>Journals</cite>, &amp;c., are not of sufficient consequence to warrant us in
offering repetitions at length.</p>

by R. Ackermann.&mdash;The devotions of Old Avarice, which are necessarily very
profound and earnest, are offered appropriately at the feet of his divinity, 'Plutus,
God of Riches'; the temple of wealth is not exteriorly sumptuous; the carpet is
a rag; a strong-box, a broken chair, and a rushlight make up the sordid furniture.
The miser is confessing that he possesses nine houses, estates in Essex, mortgages
in Hertford, large landed speculations in Russell Square and the neighbourhood,
reversions of estates, trading ventures, 'Mermaid' sloop, funded
property, Government securities, &amp;c., &amp;c.; he is beseeching an increase of his
means, success to his investments, and a rise in the 'Stocks.'</p>

<p><i>June 4, 1801.</i> <em>The Widow's Prayer.</em>&mdash;A widow, still young and blooming,
is shown kneeling before the empty chair of the late lamented partner of her
joys; the bereaved lady is looking forward to consolation; her supplications are
offered to Hymen for a fourth spouse, and she is praying, that should the new
husband who is to follow be as unfortunate as his predecessors, the number of
happy men may be extended to seven; or more if need be.</p>

<p><i>June 25, 1801.</i> <em>The Maid of Allwork's Prayer.</em>&mdash;The picture at the head
of this invocation represents a neat and pretty young housemaid; she is offering
up her petitions to the household gods who preside over cleanliness and good
management. The desires of her heart are that a handsome fellow-servant may
gain the humble worshipper and lead her into the <em>frying-pan</em> of matrimony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_31" id="Page_ii_31">[31]</a></span>
Let these but be her <em>wages</em> and she will submit cheerfully to her labours, nor
ever breathe a sigh for greater liberty than to <em>make her bed</em> in peace and sleep
contented.</p>

<p><i>July 30, 1801.</i> <cite>The Apothecary's Prayer</cite> is appropriately offered to Esculapius,
and is truly professional in spirit, since the aspirations of the little knight
of the pestle are turned to the increase of fevers, catarrhs, gout, cramp, agues,
and infirmities in general, for the special advantage of his slack professional
prospects and the good of his generous ally the undertaker, who is in need of
the apothecary's friendly co-operation, the demand for funerals having fallen off
of late.</p>

<p><i>July 30, 1801.</i> <cite>The Quack Doctor's Prayer</cite> is addressed, over a chest of patent
quack medicines, to the illustrious shade of the renowned Doctor Rock. The
empiric candidly confesses that his miraculous <em>Cure-all-able Vegetable Drops</em>, <em>Never
Infailibus Infallibus</em>, supposed to issue from the laboratory of Esculapius himself,
are nothing more than a decoction of beetroot, lump-sugar, spring-water, cognac
brandy, and Hollands gin. The Quack Doctor prays that his carriages and
equipages, his town and country residences, and all other good things of life, may
be continued to reward his impudent charlatanism.</p>

<p><i>August 1, 1801.</i> <cite>The Stockjobber's Prayer</cite> is prayed by the pious speculator,
bank-book in hand, and is offered to the adorable and ancient Lady of
Threadneedle Street. The wishes of the stockjobber refer to 'rises in the
Funds' and 'undertakings in the <em>Alley</em>,' and conclude with a pious hope that
he may never have the misfortune to '<em>waddle out</em> a poor and neglected lame
duck.'</p>

<p><i>August 1, 1801.</i> <cite>The Female Gambler's Prayer</cite> commences with an invocation:
'Enchanting Pharaoh, thee I address with a heart teeming with gratitude
for all the favours showered on thy ardent worshipper. Thy name, O
mighty Pharaoh, is derived from the Hebrew, literally to <em>make bare</em>, and well
thou knowest I delight to make bare, even to the last feather, the pigeon that
flies to my midnight orgies.' The petition concludes with an entreaty that the
Right Honourable Fraternity of Gamblers may be protected from the strictures
of Lord Kenyon (who had commenced a crusade against fashionable gamblers,
and had especially made attacks on those ladies of rank who encouraged tables
in their houses), and their persons preserved from all the dire horrors of the stocks
and pillory, with which this inflexible judge had threatened the incorrigible, if
any person could be found to bring them within his jurisdiction.</p>

<p><i>August 10, 1801.</i> <cite>The Actress's Prayer.</cite>&mdash;'Hear me, Dramatic Sisters, gay
Thalia and sublime Melpomene; be guardians to your supplicant and aid her
in her profession.... I pray thee, should I ever reach the boards of a London
theatre, may my terms be as enormous as my abilities are conspicuous, and finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_32" id="Page_ii_32">[32]</a></span>
my labours be crowned with the <em>coronet</em> of honour, and that I may become a
convert to domestic happiness.'</p>

<p><i>August 10, 1801.</i> <cite>The Jockey's Prayer</cite> is put up to Nimrod. The aspirations
of the hero of the turf tend to a wife&mdash;'a pretty well-bred filly, one that
would come easily to collar, prance to the Circus of Hymen, and run with her
owner the generous race of mutual affection.'</p>

<p><i>September 5, 1801.</i> <cite>The Cook's Prayer.</cite>&mdash;The fat mistress of the spit has
gone down on her knees before the roaring fire, beside which are the preparations
for dinner. Her prayer is addressed to all the gods and goddesses
whose celestial appetites are not too refined to relish the good things of this
world. She beseeches their influence to continue her a twelvemonth longer
in the service of Alderman Gobble, and then, with the little perquisites she
has hashed together, she may be able to enter on a certain eating-house in Pye
Corner, which she has longed for these three years. She concludes by entreating
that the bosom of John the Coachman may be moved to become her partner in
the concern.</p>

<p><i>September 12, 1801.</i> <cite>The Sailor's Prayer.</cite>&mdash;'O mighty Neptune! hear an
honest British Tar; thou knowest I trouble not thy godship every day, and I
therefore pray thee to grant my prayer, for I love not long palavering and that
there, d'ye see ... Worthy Master Neptune! send us a good prize, I beseech
thee, and be not sparing in brandy and tobacco. Give us also a few
chests of the Don's dollars, for Mounseer hasn't got none&mdash;no more than there
is in your three-pronged boat-hook.'</p>

<p><i>September 20, 1801.</i> <cite>The Publican's Prayer.</cite>&mdash;'Holy Silenus, father of all-inspiring
Bacchus, continue, I beseech you, the custom of the original Golden
Lion, and inspire me, its landlord, with becoming gratitude for all thy favours.
Grant me success, I pray thee, with the rich widow of the adjoining street, whom
thou knowest I adore; send that she may frequently look into the bar, till in time
she becomes its fixed ornament. Grant but this addition to my stock in trade,
and I have nothing to ask thee for but plenty of smuggled spirits and protection
from the exciseman.'</p>

<p><i>September 20, 1801.</i> <cite>Poll of Portsmouth's Prayer</cite> is addressed to Thetis.
The supplications of this damsel, who is gaily attired in bright colours, and ornamented
with numerous coral necklaces, bracelets, watches, seals, lockets, and
trinkets, gifts from tars at sea, are directed to prayers for the safe and speedy
return of her numerous generous admirers, then on board their ships.</p>

<p>1801. <cite>The Lottery Office Keeper's Prayer.</cite>&mdash;This invocation is offered by a
prosperous-looking individual to Dame Fortune, whose portrait forms the signboard
of his establishment, 'Peter Puff's Lucky Lottery Office.' He prays the
blindfold goddess to grant insurance to his schemes, so that they may turn up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_33" id="Page_ii_33">[33]</a></span>
prizes, and prevent his looking blank when bowing at the altar of his divinity.
'And lastly, I pray thee, with the indulgent aid of mighty superiferous Somnus,
to cause all old women and children to dream incessantly on the advantages
gained by venturing in the lottery; so shall the nocturnal visions of old chairs
and tables be converted into lucky numbers, and thy humble petitioner benefited
thereby.'</p>

<p><i>March 18, 1801.</i> <cite>The Union Head-dress.</cite> Published by R. Ackermann,
101 Strand.&mdash;A pair of busts, the fancy portraits of two highly-caricatured individuals,
whose faces wear a most dejected expression, from whose respective
foreheads branch a pair of well-defined horns.&mdash;'This style of decoration represents
"The Union Head-dress," successively worn by many respectable citizens
since the days of Noah; for its simplicity and elegance it cannot be too much
admired. Respectfully dedicated to the fashion-mongers of 1801.' The satire of
this print, which appears somewhat coarse and uncalled-for, is levelled at the fashion,
which raged contemporaneously with its publication, for embodying in the reigning
mode any event which happened to be stirring, no matter its frivolity or gravity,
as the case might be. The accomplishment of the union between England and
Ireland was seized by the milliners and fashion-mongers as the excuse for a
thousand extravagances in head-dresses, combining supposititious emblems of
the twin kingdoms with allusions to their happy conjunction.</p>

a spot of some temptation to the personage who forms the subject of the
caricature, an eccentric celebrity, without doubt, at the time of the publication.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_34" id="Page_ii_34">[34]</a></span>
The establishment of Mrs. Woods is evidently the rock a-head which threatens
the venerable senator; Mrs. Woods, the lady abbess, is, with one of her decoying
nymphs, standing at the door of her mansion; two more syrens are beckoning the
passer-by from a window, and various houris appear above, all issuing their invitations
to the M.P., an individual of consideration. The amorous character of the
vicinity is indicated by the circumstances surrounding a coach, which is driving by.
The coachman has a pretty girl on his box, and while he is publicly saluting her
cheek, his fare, an officer, is kissing a fair companion in the vehicle, and two street
Arabs, a boy and a girl, are stealing a ride on the back, and they too are indulging
in a loving embrace, disregarding the insecurity of their situation.</p>

One of them is smoking old Virginia, while his friend is favouring him with certain

of the cause, and dressed as he has left his shop-board, is the plaintiff; the
defendant has brought a pair of nether garments into court as evidence; he is
resolutely endeavouring to support his case, while the small clothes in question are
held out at the end of his cane for the investigation of the obviously reluctant judge,

W. Fores, 50 Piccadilly.&mdash;A 'fine lady,' presumably an <em>Anonyma</em> of the period,
finds herself in the fastness of a spunging house; she is made as welcome
as circumstances will permit; a bottle of wine, the refreshment customary, is
ordered, and the stern hearts of the sheriff's men are appealed to, while bail is
sent for. It was a well-known practice at the beginning of the century, and
earlier, to pay some obscure individual a trifling fee to become security on emergencies.
Similar fictitious householders were always in attendance, and producible
from the bar-rooms in the neighbourhood. In the present case a professional
limb, of the Hebrew persuasion, is presented, decently made up for the occasion,
to tender himself as bondsman for the lady's due appearance. It is evident, however,
that a suspicious recognition is taking place; 'Harry Holdfast, Officer to
the Four Counties,' or his deputy, does not, judging from his expression, seem
to approve of the surety, and the Jew looks somewhat disconcerted under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_38" id="Page_ii_38">[38]</a></span>
inspection. The tears of the unfortunate captive, and the plausible reassurances&mdash;as
to the respectability of the bail offered&mdash;of her chaperone, or duenna, are
powerless to move the stoic breast of the experienced catchpole.</p>

ladder resting against the sill. The tailor, with his measure round his neck, is snipping

of the present sketch. Who can resist a dashing young soldier? The rustic beauty
seems unequivocally smitten, and does not disguise the compromising fact that 'she
dotes on the military.' The gallant son of Mars has been quartered on a prosperous
farmer, who loves good cheer and brave company; the corporal is made welcome
at bed and board, and the best in the house is prepared for his delectation. The
venerable Hawbuck does not, however, seem pleased with the way his guest is
carrying on with his buxom daughter, who is but too clearly smitten with the soldier's
charming freedoms and his fine feathers; it is more than the parent bargained for,
and even his dog is looking on with astonishment. But the scandalised parent and
the young rustic lounging in the doorway, possibly an acknowledged sweetheart, are
at a discount; their authority is likely to be set at defiance. As for the disconcerted
swain whose dejected air and attitude express the profundity of his despair, he will
probably do something desperate; in dudgeon at his blighted hopes he may very
likely fall under the beguiling corporal's spell, offer himself as a recruit, be 'listed,
and thenceforth forsake the plough-tail to follow the drum; a lasting text against
one of the many evils consequent upon the maintenance of a standing army.</p>

blushing, and smiling, such as Rowlandson with his etching needle or his
reed pen could produce at will, and in every degree of perfection; corpulent
matrons, dowagers, and gothic old maids are likewise plentiful. There is a

as droll as any which Rowlandson has drawn. The scene represents the interior
of <em>a Bagnio</em>, '<em>Hot and Cold Baths</em>, <em>cupping</em>, <em>sweating</em>, &amp;c., &amp;c.' From the
picture it would seem that the bath-attendants of the period, who administered
the rough towellings and flesh brushings, which are indicated in the plate, were
not of the sex one generally expects to find discharging these functions in our
own day. In the case of <em>The Diver</em> no very glaring impropriety is suggested&mdash;the
individual in question is like a ball of flesh; the image, on an exaggerated
scale, of the Chinese joss-figures, and literally perfectly spherical; his quaint
image is reflected in the water as he plunges forward in a sort of cricket-ball
bound; a print of Narcissus gazing on his form in the fountain, suspended on
the wall, suggests a sufficiently striking contrast.</p>

S. W. Fores, 50 Piccadilly.&mdash;The attractions of a cheap French table d'h&ocirc;te
are ludicrously set forth; while the ravenous diners are represented making the
best use of their opportunities within the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle &agrave; manger</i>, the delicate character of
the attendance and the culinary department are slyly hinted. We are admitted
to the secrets of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la cuisine Fran&ccedil;aise</i>, as they have seemingly been revealed to the
caricaturist. The slovenly old cook is emptying the morsels left from the plates
of the customers, into the capacious <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pot-au-feu</i>, to reappear dished up for succeeding
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">convives</i>. A lean cat is seated in the frying pan, probably in course of
fattening for the spit; as to the larder, the main provisions consist of dead cats
and frogs; it was an accepted axiom that all the <em>Jean Crapauds</em>, as our Gallic
neighbours were playfully christened by John Bull, lived more or less on frogs.
Rowlandson, as we have shown, had French relatives, and had studied in Paris
and spoke the language with fluency; while those travellers who were familiar
with native habits, from travelling abroad, stoutly maintained that such were
the staples of the national food, being convinced of the truth of the formula,
as asserted by the waggish Peter Pindar&mdash;'I've liv'd among them and have eat
their frogs!'</p>

platform which has been erected for this celebration is more suggestive
of an execution than a coronation; a body of the old Guards, in their bear-skin
caps, surround the raised space. The Pope is present in full canonicals, to
perform the ceremony in person. A gallows has been considerately provided,
in order to lower the imperial crown on to the brows of the future wearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_45" id="Page_ii_45">[45]</a></span>
more conveniently. On the gallows is painted, 'Patrick Death, Gibbet-maker
to his Imperial Majesty the Emperor of all the Gulls.' The Pope,
who holds the string, which works over a pulley, and suspends the Crown, is
crying somewhat irreverently: 'In a little while you shall see him, and in a
little while you shall not see him.' The weight of the diadem is too much for
the wearer and his new throne, the planks of the platform are broken through,
and the future emperor is sinking beneath, while calling to his confederate
Talleyrand, 'My dear Talleyrand, save me! my throne is giving way. I am
afraid the foundation is rotten, and wants a cursed deal of mending!' His
prime minister is much concerned, 'Ah, master, the crown is too heavy for you!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_46" id="Page_ii_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Another pillar of the Church is pointing out that the Corsican has not acted
with his usual cunning, 'You forgot your old Uncle, the new bishop&mdash;if you had
made me Pope I should have let the crown down easier!' The ceremony is
parodied in the background, monkeys taking the place of the actual performers,
only in this case the imperial ape is seated in state, with sceptre and orb, in
greater security.</p>

<p><em>Melpomene.</em> And pray, Mr. Monarch, how long am I to be confined to this <em>box fever</em>,

what between your <em>Blind Bargain</em> and <em>Infant Roscius</em>, you think to send me to the ground;
but let me caution you, that 'if once I do but stir or lift this arm, the best of you shall
sink in my rebuke. Give me to know how this foul rout began, who set it on, and he that
is approved in the offence, though he hath twinned with me, <em>both at a birth</em> shall lose me.'</p>

<p><em>First Monarch.</em> [Probably intended to designate Sheridan.] Why really, Madam,
all I can say in my defence or that of my <em>Infant</em> is this, that if John Bull chooses
to feed on slink calf, instead of substantial roast beef, <em>yet consents to pay for the roast</em>,
it is not for me to complain; but, Madam, should there be a fault laid at my charge,
let me tell you it is not entirely mine; your brother here, beside me, has had <em>his
share</em> in it, and between friends, I must observe, that you have had your day; and if a
good salary during this <em>Infant fever</em> and frigid weather cannot encourage you to wear
flannel, gird up your loins, and rest contented on your arm (I mean arms). I will be
bound to say, you are not the woman I took you for; and rather than <em>be subject</em> to
such complaints while I <em>reign</em> 'King of shreds and patches,' I would forego the advantages
of government, and 'live on scraps at proud men's surly doors.'</p>

<p><em>Second Monarch.</em> [John Philip Kemble, otherwise familiarly designated <em>Black Jack</em>.]
Sister, be of comfort, our friend speaks home; you may relish him more in the soldier than
the scholar, but though his oratory is bad, his <em>argumentum argentum</em> is good; his voice like
mine is husky; but his <em>silver</em> tones are delightful. It is true we have both had our day;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_47" id="Page_ii_47">[47]</a></span>
'our May of life is gone; 'tis fallen into the sear, the yellow leaf, and that which should

merely players.' Public taste is similar, it is now in second childishness; and when mere
oblivion takes place, then you shall make a sally, and should the Town require a <em>filip</em>,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I

as doctor, is holding the new Emperor, an infant in long clothes, the crown is
on his head, a sceptre and orb are in either hand. John Bull, spectacles on
nose, and with his hand in his waistcoat pocket, has stepped in; he is much
astonished at the change of affairs: 'Pray Mr. Abb&eacute; Si&egrave;yes, what was the cause
of the poor Lady's death? She seemed at one time in a tolerable thriving way.'

fashion, as the 'champion of the seas;' there is an air of satirical quizzing about
his features, and, in order that he may be able to distinguish his transmogrified
acquaintance, he has mounted a pair of huge magnifiers, 'Bless me, what comes
here, it's time to put on my large spectacles, and tuck up my trousers! Why,
surely, it can't be?&mdash;it is Boney too, for all that; why, what game be'est thee at

<p><i>February 3, 1805.</i> <cite>Quarterly Duns, or Clamorous Tax-gatherers.</cite> Published
by Howitt, 73 Wardour Street, Soho.&mdash;Taxation in 1805 raised a great
deal of bad feeling; the satirists treated the increased imposts, and the methods
of collecting them, from their point of view, and made the public smile at ills to
which perforce they were compelled to submit. The house of a quack practitioner
in 'Rotten Row,' one Dr. Humbug, at the sign of the Golden Pestle of
Hippocrates, who advertises 'advice gratis' on his front door, is the scene of a
general muster of the inquisitors and collectors of taxes. <em>Window Tax</em>, <em>Income</em>,
<em>Property</em>, <em>House</em>, <em>Servants</em>, <em>Horses</em>, <em>Dogs</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em>, are among the requisitions to be
levied. <em>The Budget opened, or how to raise the wind for the year 1805</em> explains
these visitations. The quack and his wife are declining to admit their duns;
they are surveying the besieging party from an upper window, and the <em>goodwill</em>
of their house is, according to a placard, <em>to be disposed of</em>. The prospect of
'Houses to Let' and of windows 'Blocked up' shows that taxation was pressing
with over-severity, and had, in reality, been carried beyond a joke.</p>

<p><i>May 15, 1805.</i> <cite>John Bull's Turnpike Gate.</cite>&mdash;On a hill is an abbey church,
lighted up with the glory of 'King, Church, and Constitution.' John Bull, standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_51" id="Page_ii_51">[51]</a></span>
before his turnpike, is guarding the pathway; on a ledge beside the post is
placed a formidable work, the <em>Test Oath</em>. The Pope, with mitre, crozier, and hood,
is mounted on his pontifical ass. 'Mr. Bull,' he says, 'I have been to Paris and
seen all the fine sights there. I now want to have a peep at that little church on
the hill, therefore let me pass the turnpike.' J. B. replies: 'If you want to go
through pay the toll; what the devil do you think I keep a turnpike gate for?'</p>

<p>A crowd of dissenters, quakers, &amp;c., in the Pope's rear, are anxious to enjoy
the opportunity: 'Though I boast not gaudy trappings,' says a quaker, 'nor am
I mounted on ass-back, yet if he goeth through, verily I should like to go through
also!' 'Verily so should I!' 'We should all like to go through!'</p>

<p>Dundas has thrust his head through a hole in the wall labelled <em>Parliamentary

and his brother Pat by his side, are watching the Scotchman's man&oelig;uvre.
'Be asy, brother Pat, I see him as plain as ever. I have plenty of ammunition
left, but I shan't fire just at present.' This print is founded on the inquiries into
Lord Melville's conduct when Treasurer of the Navy.</p>

Lord.</cite> Published by T. Rowlandson, 1 James Street, Adelphi. Republished
July 14, 1812.&mdash;The features of a sudden rise in life form humorous materials in
the hands of the caricaturist. The lately created nobleman, a coarse and common
clothier, is swaggering in all his new finery, to give his past associates a taste of
his new-found honours. His showy court dress is assumed with awkward pretension;
he wears a ribbon and star and a dress sword; none of these decorations
harmonise with the wearer, who is so evidently out of place in his fine feathers,
that the journeymen tailors and cobblers, his neighbours and recent comrades,
are jeering at his burlesque dignity; his lady dressed in unbecoming finery, and
carrying a large plume of feathers on her head, looks no less 'out of character'
than does her tailoring spouse. The shop, over which appears, <em>Stitchall, Whitechapel,
Breeches cleaned and repaired</em>, once the pride of the pair, is now closed.
A placard states: 'The goodwill of this shop to be sold, removed to Grosvenor
Square;' while an old Jewess, part of the establishment, probably the ancestress
of one of the pair, is trying her hardest, on the top of some steps, to wipe out
the offensive name of the ex-proprietor.</p>

stands the British Lion, contemptuously pouring a broadside into the retreating
invader; the British cruisers are sweeping the seas. The Emperor, seated on a
donkey, is limping off, to the delight of some French monkeys. The national
prototype's contributions, in the shape of a shower of shot, have capsized the iron
crown of Milan. 'Bless me, what a shower! I shall be wet through before I
reach the Rhine.' The Emperor and his steed are overloaded with sacks of

<p><i>October 2, 1805.</i> <a href="#BULL_OPERA"><cite>John Bull at the Opera.</cite></a> Published by T. Rowlandson.&mdash;It
is a matter of no surprise to find Rowlandson, who, in spite of his acquaintance
with the Continent, was as thoroughly confirmed a John Bull as his illustrious predecessor
Hogarth, ridiculing the tastes of the fashionable public, who patronised
and petted exotic artists, to the neglect of native talent. Like the rest of the
caricaturists, he traded on the national spirit, and held up foreigners to contempt
and ridicule; with a happy faculty for seizing their grotesque points, their loose
ways of life, and their love of finery and display, which has not, we will venture
to believe, been excelled in any day. It is natural the school-fellow, fellow-student
at the Academy, and familiar intimate through life, of such a talented
English performer as Bannister, should have resented the artificial taste which
heaped wealth on comparatively obscure aliens, with whose art plain John Bull
could have slight sympathy, while the most rarely gifted of his countrymen
were left to struggle through life without a due acknowledgment, in a pecuniary
sense, proportioned to the extent of their merits, as contrasted with the abilities
of their foreign rivals, and the fabulous salaries they received. The designer has
accordingly displayed the signor from a whimsical point of view; the face of the
performer is suggestive of that of the good-looking youth, the leading figure in
the eccentric humours of an <cite>Italian Family</cite> (1792); it was probably a portrait
recognisable at the period. Certainly John Bull, in the artist's view, does not
appear much at home at the Italian Opera; the spectators are divided between
gigglers and gapers, and on the whole it is doubtful if their imported entertainer
affords his audience the unequivocal enjoyment they would have been able to secure
at the hands of 'honest Jack Bannister,' and native performers of his stamp.</p>

that he was not in the situation to draw the incidents from actual observation,&mdash;is
transpiring on the outside of a Young Ladies' Seminary, where maidens are 'boarded
and educated,' and their minds trained. According to the notice-board, there
seems no reason to question this being a 'finishing school' in the fullest acceptation
of the expression. 'The young ideas' are shooting in a precocious fashion
which is setting the restraint of the governesses at defiance. Certain well-favoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_55" id="Page_ii_55">[55]</a></span>
young house painters are inciting the mischievous hoydens to disregard the injunctions
of their preceptresses. A daring scamp is stealing a kiss from a buxom
belle, over the eaves of the adjoining house, and three terrible young flirts are
exchanging pleasantries with a youth on a ladder, who is stopping the torrent of
menace, poured forth by the mistress, by bedaubing his whitewash brush in the
learned features of the infuriated old lady. It is evidently early morning, before
the customary studies have commenced.</p>

<p>1805. Illustrations to <cite>Tom Jones, or the History of a Foundling</cite>. Book 7,
chap. 14.&mdash;'The clock had now struck twelve, and every one in the house were in
their beds, except the sentinel who stood to guard Northerton, when Jones
softly opening his door, issued forth in pursuit of his enemy, of whose place of confinement
he had received a perfect description from the drawer. It is not easy
to conceive a much more tremendous figure than he now exhibited. He had on,
as we have said, a light coloured coat, covered with streams of blood. His face,
which missed that very blood, as well as twenty ounces more drawn from him
by the surgeon, was pallid. Round his head was a quantity of bandages, not
unlike a turban. In the right hand he carried a sword, and in the left a candle.
So that the bloody Banquo was not worthy to be compared to him. In fact,
I believe a more dreadful apparition was never raised in a churchyard, nor
in the imagination of any good people met in a winter evening over a Christmas
fire in Somersetshire.</p>

<p>'When the sentinel first saw our hero approach, his hair began gently to lift
up his grenadier cap, and in the same instant his knees fell to blows with each
other. Presently his whole body was seized with worse than an ague fit. He
then fired his piece, and fell flat on his face.</p>

<p>'Whether fear or courage was the occasion of his firing, or whether he took
aim at the object of his terror, I cannot say. If he did, however, he had the
good fortune to miss his man.</p>

<p>'Jones seeing the fellow fall, guessed the cause of his fright, at which he could
not forbear smiling, not in the least reflecting on the danger from which he had
just escaped. He then passed by the fellow, who still continued in the posture
in which he fell.... The report of the firelock alarmed the whole house....</p>

<p>'Before Jones could reach the door of his chamber, the hall where the sentinel
had been posted was half full of people, some in their shirts, and others not half
dressed, all very earnestly inquiring of each other what was the matter.</p>

<p>'The soldier was now found lying in the same place and posture in which we
just now left him. Several immediately applied themselves to raise him, and
some concluded him dead; but they presently saw their mistake, for he not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_56" id="Page_ii_56">[56]</a></span>
struggled with those who laid their hands on him, but fell a roaring like a bull.
In reality he imagined so many spirits or devils were handling him; for his
imagination, being possessed with the horror of an apparition, converted every
object he saw or felt into nothing but ghosts and spectres.</p>

<p>'At length he was overpowered by numbers, and got upon his legs; when
candles being brought, and seeing two or three of his comrades present, he came
a little to himself; but when they asked him what was the matter, he answered, "I
am a dead man, that's all; I am a dead man; I can't recover it; I have seen him."'</p>

<p>'"What hast thou seen, Jack?" says one of the soldiers. "Why, I have seen
the young volunteer that was killed yesterday."'</p>

under the portly figure of Falstaff; Sheridan, Petty, and other Ministers do
duty as his followers. The unwieldy knight is standing in the presence of John
Bull, and pointing to a huge pack, 'Ten per cent, on John Bull's property,'
which is to be fitted to the national back. 'Mercy on us, how you must be all
changed in your way of thinking! When Billy proposed the same thing, one of
you said it was a most flagrant instance of injustice and inequality; another that
it was abominable in principle and in its operation, not only cruel but intolerable;
and another went so far as to say that if I sanctioned it I was not a person for
any honest man to be acquainted with. What have you to say for yourselves?'</p>

<p>Falstaff has a plausible explanation at the service of his employer: 'You
cannot blame us, Master Bull, we did not make it, or steal it; it lay in our way,
and we found it!'</p>

<p>Old Maids are doomed to lead Apes in Hell.
</p>

<p>An old Tabitha, who is appropriately surrounded by her feline friends, has
been disturbed from her slumbers by various suspicious nocturnal sounds, and
has appeared, candle in hand, and in a very incomplete toilette, to fathom the
mystery, of the source of which she has evidently some shrewd suspicion; since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_59" id="Page_ii_59">[59]</a></span>
she is hastening to the first floor to her niece's apartment. Above the balustrade
stands the guilty damsel, who has had sufficient warning, as her lover,
carrying his garments in his hand, for expedition, is making his way from the niece's
room under the cover of an ambuscade; while the lady is leaning over the staircase
railings, with an air of startled innocence assumed to carry off the <em>contretemps</em>.</p>

<p><i>May, 1806</i>. <cite>Recruiting on a Broad-Bottom'd Principle.</cite> Published by T.
Blacklock, 92 Royal Exchange.&mdash;Grenville, Fox, and their colleagues, are out
on a recruiting expedition, to enlist volunteers for their new service. Lord
Grenville, as the recruiting sergeant, is haranguing the bystanders; his followers
are rather of the tatterdemalion order: they wear the red caps of Liberty, and
the revolutionary cockades, they are out-at-elbows and shoeless. Sheridan is
waving the colours inscribed 'God save the King! No Jacobins!' Fox is
drummer, Lord Derby is fifer; 'Now my brave fellows, now is the time to
make your fortunes and show your loyalty, all on a Broad-Bottom'd principle:
we don't value <em>candle-ends</em> and <em>cheese-parings</em>, not we! All lives, and fortune-soldiers
to a man. We'll make our enemies tremble; we are the boys to <em>wind</em>
'em; now is your time, my lads; the bed of Honour is a bed of Down.' A dog,
the <em>Member for Barkshire</em> according to his collar, is bow-wowing the sergeant's
address; one of the audience, with a paper, <em>Bed of Roses</em> (to which the ministerial
condition had been likened by Lord Castlereagh), in his pocket, is half
decided to join their standard: 'I don't like a bed of Down, I would rather it
was a <em>Bed of Roses</em>: however I have a great mind to enter notwithstanding, there
is nothing like having two strings to one's bow.'</p>

<p>George the Third is peeping through his spyglass; he is not very clear as to
the actual motives of the party: 'What, what! my sergeant and drummer beating
up for volunteers; that's right, that's right, get as many as you can!'</p>

<p><i>May 4, 1806.</i> <cite>Daniel Lambert, the wonderful great Pumpkin of Little
Britain.</cite> Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;The famous Leicester
giant, or rather fat man, Daniel Lambert, was the object of fashionable curiosity
at this date. The worthy and good-natured-looking monster's figure is set forth
at full, and justice is done to his corpulence. A tailor and his journeyman are
between them vainly trying to stretch their measuring tape round the colossal
girth; a fairly conditioned man-cook has just brought in a noble rib of beef
for the regalement of the giant. Three modishly dressed persons of quality,
who have come to admire the huge proportions of Daniel Lambert, are contrasting
their own meagre condition of genteel slimness with his excessive
plumpness. A notice sets forth, 'Agricultural society for the improvement of
fat cattle. Leicestershire Ram'; and a placard advertises, 'The powers of
Roast Beef, or the Leicestershire Apollo, now in full bloom; no blemish whatever
on any part of his body. Thirty-six years of age. Weighs upwards of 50 stone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_60" id="Page_ii_60">[60]</a></span>

<p><i>May 31, 1806.</i> <cite>A Diving Machine on a New Construction.</cite> Published by
T. Rowlandson, 1 James Street, Adelphi.&mdash;The unpopular increase of Taxation,
levied under the Broad-bottom'd auspices, was severely dealt with by the
satirists. In the present version, the Ministers are represented as the crew
of a diving-barge, <em>The Experiment</em>. Fox is the diver, and a noble wreck, the
'Constitution cutter, John Bull commander,' has gone down to the bottom of the
'Ocean of Taxation.' Her commander is done for; amidst the spoils of the
shipwreck, the Diver (Fox) is securing certain weighty additions to his treasury:
pig-iron, Beer Tax, and heavy chests, '10 per cent.' are among the spoils. A rope
is secured to the ponderous Property Tax; Fox is giving the word to 'Haul up;'
Petty, Sheridan and others are hauling away at the ropes; their lighter is nearly
filled with the precious wreckage they have been able to secure.</p>

<p><i>June 20, 1806.</i> <cite>The Acquittal, or upsetting the Porter Pot.</cite> Published by
T. Rowlandson, 1 James Street, Adelphi.&mdash;Lord Melville and his counsel are
exulting over the results of his acquittal by his peers of the charge of investing
the public funds for his personal advantage, as far as the interest was concerned,
a perquisite previously allowed to the Treasurer of the Navy. When Lord
Melville, then Henry Dundas, filled the post of Treasurer to the Navy, he
brought in an act for the better regulation of that office, making such employment
of the funds in hand a misdemeanour; Whitbread, (at the head of
the advanced Liberals, or 'Radical Reformers,' who began to make his party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_61" id="Page_ii_61">[61]</a></span>
dreaded as formidable opponents of the old-fashioned Whig section, from which his
supporters had receded), and Wilberforce, as the enemy of all corruptions, were the
principal movers of Melville's impeachment, for the alleged breach of his own act.</p>

<p>The two Scots, Melville and Trotter, who are dressed in Highland garb, are
embracing fraternally; at the same time, Melville is giving a sly backward kick
to a huge pewter pot, bearing the face of the disconcerted mover of the charges.
<em>Whitbread's Entire Butt</em> is knocked over, its contents <em>Impeachments</em>, <em>High
Crimes</em>, <em>Misdemeanours</em>, and <em>Peculation</em>, are flowing away unheeded; 'What is
life without a friend?' cries the ex-Minister on his acquittal; his counsel, Trotter,
is assuring his relieved patron, 'I'll <em>trot</em> for you! I'll gallop for you all over the
globe. O happy day for Scotland! and see how pleased John Bull looks&mdash;ah
Johnny, Johnny, this is indeed a glorious triumph.' But Mr. Bull declines to be
soft-sawdered: his face is wearing anything but a satisfied expression; he significantly
keeps his hands in his pockets, and is grumbling, 'I say nothing,' as if he
could say a great deal if he were disposed to express his honest opinion of the
entire transaction.</p>

<p><i>July 21, 1806.</i> <cite>Experiments at Dover, or Master Charleys Magic Lantern.</cite>
Published by T. Rowlandson, 1 James Street, Adelphi.&mdash;The repeated delays
to the preliminaries for peace, and the various man&oelig;uvres of Buonaparte's
government, which protracted the issue of Fox's policy, led to a feeling out-of-doors
that the Minister was not dealing straightforwardly with the public; that
dissimulation was thrown into their eyes like dust; and that the Whig chief
was deluding his followers for some reasons of his own; meanwhile the Corsican
Emperor was carrying forward plans for fresh aggressions unchecked.</p>

<p>Fox, in the print, has settled himself comfortably at Dover; with a magic
lantern to work his delusions, he is throwing painted images across the Channel,
which are reflected on the cliffs of Calais. The figure of Napoleon is seen
sounding a news-horn, announcing 'Preliminaries of Peace'; Fox's slide contains
other views, which have to follow, for the further perplexity of the honest
spectator: 'More despatches,' 'Messenger to Paris,' 'Messenger from Boulogne,'
&amp;c. The Showman is trying to reassure his friend, 'There, Master Bull, what
do you think of that? I told you I would surprise you&mdash;"Preliminaries of Peace,"
'Huzza!' John Bull, who is standing unconvinced behind Fox's chair, replies:
'Yes, yes, it be all very foine, if it be true. But I can't forget that <span class="locked">d&mdash;&mdash;d</span>
Omnium last week; they be always one way or other in contradictions! I will

<p><i>June, 1806.</i> <a href="#BUTTERFLY"><cite>Butterfly Hunting.</cite></a> Published by Wm. Holland, 11 Cockspur

the title of 'Butterfly Hunting.' Nothing can stop the fervour of the butterfly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_62" id="Page_ii_62">[62]</a></span>
collectors in their chase of the sportive prey, wantonly flitting all over the flower-beds,
and leading the excited entomologists a pretty dance, carrying destruction
to the parterres, and ruination to the tulips, of which the proprietor of the house
and grounds is, it appears, a passionate fancier. The havoc, which is spreading
over the beds of his favourites, is reducing him to frenzy; as he is awakened
from his rest, and surveys from his bedroom-window the field of action, the only
wonder is, if he has a loaded gun ready at hand, that he is not tempted to salute
the reckless spoilers with a volley.</p>

hat, worn on one side of his battered and lined old face; a long pigtail projects
over his high shoulders; he swaggers with one hand on his hip, and the other
on the head of a tasseled cane, which is nearly as tall as the hero himself; his
shrunken spindle legs are thrust into huge boots, and his tremendous sword,
which is longer than the wearer, is trailing on the ground. The argument is not
complimentary to commanders in general: 'Some school-boys, who were playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_63" id="Page_ii_63">[63]</a></span>

<p><i>February 3, 1807.</i> <cite>The Captain's Account-current of Charge and Discharge.</cite>
Published by Giles Grinagain, 7 Artillery Street, London.&mdash;A pair of plates
connected with some militia or yeomanry satire of the period: the scene of the
captain's misadventure is evidently a cathedral town, but the interest of the print
is not sufficiently strong to make any elucidation of the facts of the case of much
importance. The captain is mounted on a spirited charger; he is losing his seat;
several whips and his sabre have fallen, and the rider is holding on precariously
by his horse's mane. Professor Gambado's famous tract, <cite>Hints to Bad Horsemen</cite>,
is thrown on the ground. The members of the troop, galloping in the rear, are
enjoying their leader's mishap, and saying, 'Our young whip is not an old
jockey.' The captain cries, 'March! trot! canter! charge! halt, halt, halt! I
mean;' while candid confessions burst forth spontaneously from the trumpet at
his side. 'Avarice, vanity! oh what a ninny I was to throw myself off! they're
laughing at me!' while hypocrisy, ingratitude, double-dealing, false friendship,
malice, &amp;c., are trumpeted forth.</p>

<p>In the second plate the rider has come to grief; the horse is prancing gaily,
relieved of his rider; the animal is addressing a parting remark to the discharged
captain: 'You seem more frightened than hurt. You have been taught the
value of whips more than the use of them.'</p>

<p>A hussar has recovered the trumpet; he stoops over to the fallen captain,
who is rubbing the seat of his injuries: 'I hope your honour is not hurt,' to
which the fallen leader replies, 'I am not hurt, upon my honour!' The troopers
are riding gaily on, exclaiming, 'Why, our captain needn't a fallen!'</p>

servant is leaving the room with a warming-pan, and a lady, of the developed
'fat, fair, and forty' order, is preparing to go to bed; the partner of her joys,
who is more youthful, has dropped his pipe and is sipping a bumper of wine;
but, although evidently sleepy, he seems disinclined to follow the lady's example
of retiring to rest.</p>

<p><i>February 18, 1807.</i> <cite>Abroad and at Home</cite> is a complete contrast to the previous
subject.&mdash;A handsome-looking man is reclining on a couch before the fire;

drops on the sly.</p>

In this case the horticultural tastes of the reverend gentleman have led him to
turn the grounds of the vicarage into a picture of the most unvarying precision:
clipped hedges, chopped borders of box, with yew-trees and evergreens, carved
into wonderful imitations of impossible objects, form the passion of his heart. A
hunted fox is darting through these wonderful works of art; the hounds are
breaking over everything, and the whole field of fox-hunters are riding through
the Vicar's boundaries, and pounding their horses over his cherished monstrosities.
Judging from the frantic state of the dignitary, the reverse of benedictions seem
likely to be invoked upon the heads of the intruders, who are wrecking the
results of any amount of misdirected patience 'in less than no time.'</p>

<p class="center">Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum.
</p>

<p>The complex nature of the famous Broad-Bottom Administration, known as <a href="#TALENTS">'All the
Talents,'</a> is set forth in an allegorical representation, which is supposed to include
the several qualifications of the vaunted <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">illumin&eacute;s</i>. It may be remembered that
this Ministry, which came into power under Liberal and popular auspices, retired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_68" id="Page_ii_68">[68]</a></span>
on the rejection of their favourite measure, Catholic Emancipation, which they
were pledged to introduce. The King, and his friends, the remnant of the
Pittites, made a desperate stand against this measure, and the consequence of its
defeat was the immediate withdrawal of 'All the Talents' from office. As
embodied by Rowlandson's pencil, the combination of heterogeneous elements
produced a curious monster: the wig of a learned judge is worn on the head of
a spectacled ape, with an episcopal mitre and a Catholic crosier; a lawyer's bands,
a laced coat, and ragged breeches; wearing one shoe, and a French jackboot;
and dancing upon a funeral pyre of papers, the results of the Administration, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_69" id="Page_ii_69">[69]</a></span>
endless negotiations with France, and its sinecures and patronages, which are
blazing away. The creature's right foot is discharging a musket, to represent
the 'Army,' which is producing certain mischief in the rear, and bringing two
heavy folios, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magna Charta</i> and the <em>Coronation Oath</em> upon the head of the
dangerous animal. The left hand, holding a pen upside-down, is supposed to be
compounding new financial projects, in a ledger laid over a music book, 'Country
dances,' an allusion to the alleged dancing proclivities of Lord Henry Petty, the
Broad-Bottomite Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<p>The smoke, from the pipe of this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lusus Natur&aelig;</i>, is obscuring the portrait of
William Pitt. The end of 'All the Talents,' who sacrificed their influence from
conscientious motives, and whose upright principles were beyond suspicion, was
a great source of triumph to their opponents, who signalised their retirement
with a volley of satirical effusions. The 'Interment of the Broad-Bottomite
Ministry' produced a shower of political squibs and caricatures; and among the
best verses on the occasion, appeared the following mocking epitaph, which has
been attributed to the gifted pen of Canning, who came into office on the dismissal
of 'All the Talents.'</p>

pretty maiden, who is thrown into consternation at the risk to which her suitor,
by an awkward <em>contretemps</em>, is suddenly exposed. The pair have evidently been
disturbed at the moment the lady was engaged in drawing a mug of ale for the
refreshment of her admirer; in the confusion, the tap of the beer barrel is still
left running, and all the maid's solicitude is centred in the position of her swain,
who has incautiously taken refuge in the copper. A very disagreeable-looking old
beldame is kindling a blazing fire in the stove, while a buxom wench is working
away at the pump, which is pouring gallons of water into the unlucky Lothario's

draining a punch-bowl and capsizing himself simultaneously; an ambitious young
reveller is tipsily trying to mount the table, and over-balancing himself in the
attempt; a stout divine is indisposed in a corner; heavy drinkers laid low are
on the floor, whence they are dragged off by their heels, and carried to bed
in an incapable and collapsed condition. Furniture is knocked over, and chimney
ornaments sent to grief. It is an anniversary meeting of choice spirits.</p>

a dandified pedestrian, daintily mincing along on tiptoe, who, at first glance, might
be taken for a live Marquis, if, on inspection, his apron and the professional implements
peeping out of his coat-tail, did not proclaim him a barber. John Bull's substantially

turning the huntsman heels over head, another cavalier's animal is standing
rigidly on his forelegs, and perseveringly attempting to dislodge his mount by
kicking out wildly behind. A third rider is no less fortunate in his hack, which
has 'no mouth,' and is moreover a 'bolter'; the animal is steadily plunging
through everything in its way, apparently unconscious of the desperate efforts
his master is making to hold him in. An old woman, with her barrow and its
contents, are tumbled over, without attracting the attention of the wrong-headed
brute, whose mind is absorbed in his own private speculations.</p>

<p>A clerical traveller has arrived, late at night, at an hostel; a pretty chamber-maid
is showing the reverend visitor to his room, bearing a lighted candle, a warming-pan,
and the saddle-bags of the guest, who appears well pleased with his
conductress, and is imparting his admiration. As it appears that this gentleman
is inclined to be less respectable than his venerated calling should suggest, it is
less scandalising to observe that various practical jokes of a rough character are
besetting his path; consequently, it is highly probable that he will receive an
active moral lesson before he reaches his chamber.</p>

<p><i>November 9, 1807.</i> <cite>Thomas Simmons, drawn from Life by Mr. Angelo.</cite>
Published by T. Rowlandson, 1 James Street, Adelphi. 'The horrid and
inhuman murderer of Mrs. Hammerstone and Mrs. Warner at the house of
Mr. Boreham, a Quaker at Hoddesdon, in Herts, on Tuesday evening, October 20,
1807.'&mdash;The barbarous murderer does not rejoice in a very formidable exterior.
His weakly person has been sketched by the hand of Henry Angelo, the well-known
fencing-master, a firm friend of Rowlandson through life. His amusing
<em>Memoirs</em> have supplied us with many circumstances relating to the caricaturist.
It appears that Angelo, Bannister, and Rowlandson were schoolfellows at an
early period of life, and they were all as youths excessively fond of their pencils;
although it was reserved for Rowlandson alone to attain proficiency in the fine
arts. Angelo, like George Selwyn, Colonel Hanger, and some few notorieties,
was fond of attending executions, visiting jails, and similar lugubrious exhibitions.
Among his visits to prisons he encountered some curious characters. Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_82" id="Page_ii_82">[82]</a></span>
Simmons, the subject of the present plate, was one of the unfortunates with
whom he became acquainted on one of these eccentric excursions.</p>

<p>From the sketch, Thomas Simmons appears a mere dwarf of a man, a harmless-looking
and apparently half-witted individual, realising the traditional idea
of <em>Simple Simon</em>. This murderer has heavy manacles round his puny limbs.
Groups of miserable prisoners, and hard-featured jailors are in the rear, and the
heavy iron doors of Newgate afford an appropriate background.</p>

<p><i>November 10, 1807.</i> <cite>Directions to Footmen.</cite> Rowlandson del. Published
by T. Tegg, 111 Cheapside (273).&mdash;'Take off the largest dishes, and set them
on with one hand, to show the ladies your vigour and strength of back, but
always do it between two ladies, that if the dish happens to slip, the soup or
sauce may fall on their clothes, and not daub the floor; by this practice, two
of our brethren, my worthy friends, got considerable fortunes.'&mdash;A stalwart
awkward-looking yokel, in a showy livery, is carrying out these useful directions
to the letter. While grinning at his horrified mistress, he is upsetting a tureen
held loosely in his right hand, over a handsome damsel, and is flooding the table-cloth,
to the horror of the company, and the delight of a poodle, which is revelling
in the stream. In the clumsy footman's left hand is held a dish, from
which he is calmly allowing the joint, gravy, &amp;c., to glide over the back of another
dog who is less pleased than his companion.</p>

<p><i>November 10, 1807.</i> <cite>John Bull making Observations on the Coast.</cite> Woodward
del., Rowlandson sculp. Published by T. Tegg, 111 Cheapside.&mdash;The
head of George the Third, as the sun, is throwing its brilliant rays across
the Channel, and shining on the British Fleet which lines the waters. The head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_83" id="Page_ii_83">[83]</a></span>
of Napoleon Buonaparte, with his cocked hat and feather, is represented as a
comet with a fiery train, which is making vicious exertions to dash itself across
the orb of day. John Bull has planted his telescope on the shores of the Channel,
and his eye is following the course of the erratic meteor: 'Ay, ay, Master
Comet, you may attempt your peri-heliums, or your devil-heliums for what I care,
but take the word of an old man, you'll never reach the sun, depend upon it.'</p>

sculp. Published by T. Tegg, 111 Cheapside.&mdash;The interior of a conjurer's
chamber, decorated with the usual paraphernalia of bats, stuffed crocodiles, &amp;c.
The empiric wears his learned robes and fur cap; in the centre of a magic
circle stands the pretended enchanter's assistant, dressed in a bullock's hide, with
the horns and tail left on, to personate the Father of Evil; a butcher, in his
working dress, has called to consult the oracle concerning a missing sheep; he
has brought his bull-dog with him, unobserved by the demonstrator, and the
animal, true to his instincts, has pinned the mock demon-bull by the nose; 'the
pretended devil roar'd most tremendously; but the dog kept a firm hold. The
conjurer, rising in a passion, exclaimed, "You scoundrel, take off your dog!" The
butcher, however, perceiving the cheat, cried out, "Not I, doctor, I know he is of
as good a breed as ever bolted, so let 'em fight fair; if you are not afraid of your
devil, I am not afraid of my dog; so dog against devil for what sum you please!"'
The fictitious demon is in bad case.</p>

<p>1807 (?). <cite>More Miseries, or the Bottom of Mr. Figg's Old Whiskey broke
through.</cite>&mdash;A serio-comic scene that befel the 'grocer's wife at Norwich, owing to
the bottom of Mr. Figg's whiskey breaking through.' The flooring of a vehicle
something like a phaeton has proved too slight for a ponderous occupant: the
lady's ample proportions are framed in the chaise, to the alarm of her husband,
who is seizing the prancing horse. Certain gazers, hugely delighted, are hastening
up not to lose the spectacle of the lady's awkward situation.</p>

<p><i>March 1, 1808.</i> <cite>The Green Dragon.</cite> Rowlandson del. Published by R.
Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;A clerical-looking and corpulent reprobate is receiving
the upbraidings of his infuriated spouse, to whom the artist has playfully given
some resemblance to a veritable dragon, with teeth, claws, and venom. The
position of affairs is further explained by a spirited representation of 'Socrates
and Zantippe,' which hangs on the wall. A pretty servant-maid, who is making
a somewhat hasty exit, is supposed to have aroused the jealousy of the virago,
whose vials of wrath have brought her stout helpmate to a state of stupefaction
and terror. The picture is accompanied by the lines of Gay, from the <cite>Beggars'</cite>

<p><i>April 1, 1808.</i> <cite>Soldiers on a March.</cite> 'To pack up her tatters and follow
the drum.' Designed and published by T. Rowlandson, 1 James Street,
Adelphi.&mdash;The progress of the regiment is much impeded by camp-followers.
A stream happening to cross the route, the marching party are wading through;
the soldiers bearing in addition to their knapsack the fairer burden of a wife,
and in some cases two infants, with kettles, gridirons, and other culinary appliances,
the latter swinging on the end of their muskets. The officer commanding
the party has the advantage of securing a mount on the plump shoulders
of a pretty damsel, whose skirts are tucked up as a preparation towards wading
across the water, with the feathered hero on her back.</p>

<p><i>May 12, 1808.</i> <cite>The Consultation, or Last Hope.</cite> Published by R. Ackermann,
101 Strand.&mdash;'So when the Doctors shake their heads, and bid their
patient think of Heaven&mdash;all's over, good night!'</p>

<p>From the picture, which rejoices in this comforting quotation, we judge the
unfortunate invalid, introduced by the artist as the principal figure in this
humorous plate, is in a bad case; his suffering face expresses all the forlorn
terrors of his extreme situation, which seems tolerably hopeless, since he is
attended by no less than ten learned practitioners, and a sick-nurse; it is hard
if among them they cannot settle their patient's condition. The ten are by no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_86" id="Page_ii_86">[86]</a></span>
means troubling themselves about their client all at once: it is sufficient that a
brace of the brethren are feeling each a pulse, which operation does not seem
to afford them much enlightenment, since one is consulting his chronometer, and
the other is seeking inspiration from the head of his gold-topped stick. Their
colleagues are more agreeably engaged in fortifying themselves for their arduous
professional duties by attending manfully to the refreshment department. The
gouty patient has evidently been a man of substance; over his mantel hangs
a map of 'Rotten Boroughs,&mdash;Camelford, Devon, &amp;c.'</p>

<p><i>May 21, 1808.</i> <cite>Volunteer Wit, or not Enough for a Prime.</cite> Woodward
del., Rowlandson sculp. Published by T. Tegg (227).&mdash;A party of Volunteer
officers are gathered round the mahogany of their entertainer, who, it seems, is
a notorious screw; the host is offering to fill the wine-glasses of the mess, but
the dimensions of the glasses are somewhat miniature for bumper toasts. A
challenge is given from the chair: 'Come, gentlemen-volunteers, to the right
and left&mdash;Charge if you please to the King!' The vice-chair is winning the
sympathies of the rest, and extracting a grin all round, by standing up, spectacles
on nose, and responding: 'I should be very happy to obey your orders, Colonel,
but really your glasses are so small, that, dash me if there's enough for a prime!'
The Colonel's miserly disposition is hinted by the various papers thrown about,
on the 'Current prices of Port wine,' and such maxims as 'A penny saved is
twopence got'; with a statement pinned to the wall, 'How to get rich,' 'Pinch,
squeeze, gripe, snatch, &amp;c.'</p>

<p>1808 (?). <cite>The Anatomy of Melancholy.</cite> ''Tis a misery to be born, a pain to
live, a trouble to die.'&mdash;A mixed scene of suffering and indifference. Propped
up in a pillowed arm-chair, before the fire, is a melancholy invalid, old, decrepit,
and ill-favoured. By his side is a list of 'Remedies against discontents,' 'Cure
of jealousy,' &amp;c.; on the mantel is an array of doctor's bottles, and a hatchment,&mdash;<em>groans,
griefs, sadness</em>,&mdash;forms a cheerful adornment for the chimneypiece.</p>

<p>Behind the sufferer, whose last hour, it seems, is approaching&mdash;since Death
has thrust his head, arm, and hour-glass through a window above his head&mdash;is
seated a blooming young damsel, decked out in all the attractiveness of an
evening toilette; planted at a table by her side is a dandified admirer; before
them a dessert is arranged, and decanters of wine are ready to hand. The nonchalant
pair are pledging one another amorously in bumpers, while the spirit of
the founder of the feast is departing. A painting of Democritus, his face wearing
an expression of grief on one side, and laughter on the other, explains the
transitory nature of sorrow, and the key of the situation is further offered by
certain lines inscribed on a paper under the lady's hand: 'Come what may, the
cat will mew, the dog will have his day.'</p>

Published by T. Tegg, 111 Cheapside. (No. 228.)&mdash;The Mothers Hope is
a pretty juvenile termagant, a Turk of the most irreclaimable order. The young
rebel is dancing about in a fine rage, scattering his playthings, and 'making a
bobbery' which is setting the entire house by the ears. The screams of the intractable
elder are imitated by an infant in arms, and a canary is adding its shrill
pipings to the general squall, after the nature of little warblers.</p>

<p>The wilful child is making a general statement of refractory resolutions:&mdash;'I
don't like dolls&mdash;I don't like canary birds&mdash;I hate battledore and shuttlecock&mdash;I
like drums and trumpets&mdash;I won't go to school&mdash;I will stay at home&mdash;I will
have my own way in everything!' The horrified grandmother is growing prophetic
on the strength of this irreconcilable prodigy: 'Bless the Baby&mdash;what an
aspiring spirit&mdash;if he goes on in this way he will be a second Buonaparte!'</p>

spectacles, a pigtail, and a powdered wig and whiskers, in the course of his
perambulations has come across a quaint round little body, as broad as she is
long, and perched on pattens: the hero is stooping low to salute the lips of the
dwarfed lady. The picture is designed as a parody upon the <span class="locked">lines:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>June 4, 1808.</i> <cite>Odd Fellows from Downing Street, complaining to John
Bull.</cite> Woodward del., Rowlandson sculp. Published by T. Tegg, 111 Cheapside
(168).&mdash;John Bull, in his best clothes, and standing in the vicinity of the
Treasury, is receiving a deputation, the members of which, as far as appearance
goes, are singularly fitted for the order of Odd-fellows. The object of their interview
is simply an appeal to the sympathies of the National Prototype: 'You
must know, Mr. Bull, we are a society of Odd Fellows who had a Lodge in
Downing Street, and were robb'd of our cash and accounts, notwithstanding we
met at the King's Head, and so near the Treasury too! Is not it very hard?
However, we have left Downing Street entirely.' John Bull, who, with his hand
beneath his coat-tails, is ruminating over other more weighty matters applying
to his own case, and peering through his huge spectacles, returns in reply: 'All
I have to say, my good friends, is this&mdash;I am very sorry for you, but I must own
I am of opinion if some more <em>Odd Fellows</em> in Downing Street were to quit their
situations it would be very much to my advantage!'</p>

<p><i>June 20, 1808.</i> <a href="#SNUG_CABIN"><cite>A Snug Cabin, or Port Admiral.</cite></a> Published by R. Ackermann,

board the ship of the port-admiral. That worthy personage is drawn entertaining
his naval colleagues, admirals, commodores, and captains, in his state
cabin, with the best of cheer; baskets of prime vintage from the Isles of the
Madeira, are ready to the nimble steward's hand, and the goodly flasks are
uncorked in a twinkling. The jorums on the mahogany are capacious, and the
glasses, which are freely emptied, would serve as goblets for more than half-pint
bumpers; however, in spite of the hilarity, and the liberal circulation of the
decanters, decorum is preserved, and the naval commanders are comporting
themselves like 'fine old English gentlemen,' while the toast goes <span class="locked">round:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>June 30, 1808.</i> <cite>Accommodation, or Lodgings to Let at Portsmouth.</cite> Published
by T. Tegg. (219.)&mdash;Certain smartly-rigged tars have just come on shore,
evidently after a handsome haul in the way of prize-money, as the spruceness
of their turn-out evinces. A highly presentable 'salt' has his wife in tow; the
lady has evidently taken a share of his good fortune, being dressed in the height
of the fashion, with ear-rings, necklets, and chains, heavy enough for cables, to
which are suspended miniatures, seals, and watches. The happy pair are
evidently about to set up housekeeping, and an advertisement-board has just
arrested their attention, conveying the information, 'Lodgings for Single Men
and their Wives,' with an invitation to ring the bell. 'Why, Nan,' exclaims the
tar to his partner, 'this is the very berth we have been so long looking after!'</p>

Woodward del., Rowlandson sculp. Published by T. Tegg, 111 Cheapside.
(220.)&mdash;The artist has assumed a little poetic licence to perpetrate a jokelet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_90" id="Page_ii_90">[90]</a></span>
a very harmless order. Groups of sailors are seated on the forecastle, some
perched on coils of rope, others on sea chests; a British tar, on a barrel, with a
canister of 'real Oronooko' by his side, is spinning a yarn to his messmates; he
has arrived at the exciting incident of his narrative:&mdash;'and so then, do you see,
David, we sprung a leak!' when his Welsh messmate, who cannot resist this
allusion to a reputed national delicacy, rather irrationally interrupts him: 'Cot
pless us&mdash;and save us&mdash;did you? and a ferry coot fetchitable it is; I should have
liked to have had a pit with you.'</p>

One of the series bearing Rowlandson's name, and published by Reeve and
Jones, 7 Vere Street.&mdash;The scene represents the consulting room of some
eminent quack of the day, who, dressed in his morning-gown and slippers, with
glasses on nose, is receiving his decrepit and melancholy patients. The comforting
assurance given by the practitioner to his patients is, it appears, totally without
foundation; all his clients, judging from their condition, being in a fair way to
supplement the Bills of Mortality.</p>

<p><i>November 1, 1808.</i> <cite>The Last Shift.</cite> Published by Reeve and Jones,

the back and saddle of his horse, he has contrived to raise himself to the level
of the lady's casement, and she is leaning out of window, and rewarding his
gallantry with a tender embrace; meanwhile her husband in his nightcap, opening
the shutter below, is securing a prospect of the proceeding, which has thrown
an expression of idiotic consternation over his simple features.</p>

<p><i>About 1808.</i> <cite>Bartholomew's Fair.</cite> Nixon del., Rowlandson sculp.&mdash;The
fun of the Fair is represented in full swing, and the humours of the scenes
displayed on all sides are seized and hit off with the usual felicity of both artists.
Judging from the caricature, the abolition of fairs in the City must have been a
boon to public order and morality. The noise, disorder, and misrule of the
festivity are taking place outside the hospital. Boat-swings are revolving, a few
of the swings are getting into difficulties, upsetting, or the bottoms coming out,
while some of the swingers find themselves indisposed from the motion. There
are wandering sellers of sweets, pastry, and such things as were devoured at
<em>fairings</em>, boys with links, for it is late, and dusk; booths for refreshments, where
customers are eating hot cakes cooked on the spot. There are drinking stalls
where tipplers are taking too much; as is illustrated in the person of a reveller
who, finding himself overcome with liquor, has laid down in the gutter to take
a little rest, an opportunity not lost sight of by the light-fingered gentry who
have come for business; the toper's watch, purse, hat, and other portable property
are swiftly transferred. There are booths for dancing, and there are
merrymakers who are managing to dance outside; there are revolving wheel-swings
and merry-go-rounds; there is a crowd of very miscellaneous merry-making
company, and parties of jolly sailors arriving outside coaches. The
harmony of the proceedings is varied by several rows; and, in more than one
spot, rings are formed for fair fighting, and both men and women are exhibiting
their prowess in the boxing line, or exchanging buffets and scratches. The signs
and booths of famous showmen, once the splendours of by-gone fairs, are disposed
around; among the spectacles which invited those of our forefathers who 'went
to see the shows,' we may notice that Rowlandson has introduced Miles'
Menagerie, Saunder's Tragic Theatre, Gingle's Grand Medley, Miss Biffin,
Polito's Grand Collection, Punch, &amp;c.</p>


<p>ROWLANDSON'S CARICATURES AGAINST BUONAPARTE.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, Rowlandson's pencil and graver were enlisted against the
Corsican; it would seem that the artist's anti-Napoleonic proclivities ran strongly
from this period until the downfall of the Emperor; or else&mdash;which is the more
reasonable solution&mdash;English prejudices against the man whose almost frantic
antagonism to this country is now forgiven, if not well-nigh forgotten, demanded
an unlimited supply of pictorial satires to stimulate the national hatred, a state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_93" id="Page_ii_93">[93]</a></span>
of things which pleased both the publishers and the public, and kept the caricaturist
occupied, although it is to be regretted that these somewhat imaginative
scenes of horror employed his ready skill to the exclusion of those representations
of social manners, and the observances of the world around him, whose eccentricities
he might have sketched from the life&mdash;scenes drawn from a quaint and
picturesque generation of which his earlier career has left us such lively pictures,
works which alone render his name worthy of his reputation, and which form
in themselves an inexhaustible and valuable legacy to his followers.</p>

<p><i>July 8, 1808.</i> <cite>The Corsican Tiger at Bay.</cite> Published by R. Ackermann,
101 Strand.&mdash;The mighty disturber of the peace of Europe is figured under the
form of a savage tiger, with his natural head, and on which he wears the
enormous military cocked hat with its long plume&mdash;most indispensable accessories
in all the caricaturist's portraits of the great 'little Corsican.' The tiger's claws
are rending four 'Royal Greyhounds,' which are quite at the mercy of the
ferocious conqueror; but a larger and stronger pack of 'Patriotic Greyhounds'
are giving tongue, and a fierce charge is being made by some very determined and
mischievous-looking hounds who are rushing up to the attack. The <em>Dutch Frog</em>,
isolated on his own little mudheap, is promising to join the fray: 'It will be my
turn to have a slap at him next.' The <em>Russian Bear</em> and the <em>Austrian Eagle</em>,
are kept in secure bondage by heavy fetters, but the triple-headed bird of prey
is looking forward to a fresh onslaught, and prompting his fellow-captive: 'Now
<em>Brother Bruin</em>, is the time to break our chains.'</p>

<p>John Bull, on his own island shores, has come out in the character of a
sportsman; he is pointing his piece at the tiger brought to bay, and is singing
nursery rhymes for the general <span class="locked">encouragement:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>There was a little man,
And he had a little gun,
And his bullets were made of lead:
D&mdash;- me, but we'll manage him amongst us!
</p>

<p><i>July 10, 1808.</i> <cite>Billingsgate at Bayonne, or the Imperial Dinner.</cite> Published
by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;The members of the Royal family of Spain,
decoyed to Bayonne, are sitting down to a very unruly repast, the entire
company being at loggerheads. The Queen has risen from table, and in true
fishfag style she is raving at her son Ferdinand, who is confronting her: 'Now,
you villain, I'll tell you to your face&mdash;and before my dear friend Boney&mdash;you
are no child of the King's&mdash;so you may shut up.' At this famous interview
the Oueen of Spain, it may be remembered, after upbraiding Ferdinand for his
usurpation, actually declared him illegitimate. This argument, according to the
print, does not demolish her opponent, who is replying: 'Madam, I know all
your tricks, and all the tricks of your Prince of Peace.' The Infants of Spain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_94" id="Page_ii_94">[94]</a></span>
are encouraging the last speaker: 'Brother, don't mind her, we, the Infants,
acknowledge you;' a terrific personage, with the emblem of a Royal crown on the
back of his seat, is banging down his fist and demanding: 'Am not I the great
Zavallos? will you be silent?' Those on the opposite side are more tranquilly
disposed; Charles, who had abdicated by Buonaparte's compulsion in favour of
his son Ferdinand, is crying: 'I wish they would let a poor old King play
quietly on his fiddle!' while one of the diners is actually paying attention to his
meal, and wishing 'they would leave him at peace.' Little Buonaparte in the
uniform of a general, as he is usually represented, has risen from a high-raised
throne, erected in accordance with his imperial state, at the head of the table;
he is affecting to be in a passion at the general discord which he had ingeniously
contrived to foster and bring about: 'I'll tell you what, if you make such a riot
at my table, I'll be <span class="locked">d&mdash;&mdash;d</span> if I don't send you to the Round House!'</p>

<p><i>July 12, 1808.</i> <cite>The Corsican Spider in his Web.</cite> Woodward del., Rowlandson
sculp. Published by T. Tegg, 111 Cheapside.&mdash;The formidable Emperor
is represented in a highly successful character as an overgrown spider; his body
is formed of 'unbounded Ambition,' which is topped with his own head, he
enjoys an amazing capacity for swallowing the surrounding insects, which seem
unable to resist being drawn into his toils. The voracious Corsican Spider in
the centre of his wide-spread web, is swallowing down a brace of <em>Spanish Flies</em>.
'Small Flies Innumerable' are entrapped in strings, and even the largest
specimens seem powerless to disentangle themselves; the Austrian, Dutch,
Portuguese, Hanoverian, Etrurian, Prussian, Hamburg, Italian, and Venetian
Flies are all more or less effectually secured; the 'Pope Fly' is half entrapped,
and is expressing a fear of being dragged in. The 'Russian Fly,' of more
hostile disposition, has caught his feet in the snare: 'I declare I was half in the
web before I made the discovery.' The 'Turkish Fly' is at present free, but
its security is uncertain; 'I am afraid it will be my turn next.' Stout John Bull
is figured as the 'British Fly'; he is observing the wiles of the 'Corsican Spider'
without any anxiety on his own account: 'Ay, you may look, master Spider, but
I am not to be caught in your web!'</p>

<p><i>July 12, 1808.</i> <cite>The Corsican Nurse soothing the Infants of Spain.</cite> Woodward
del., Rowlandson sculp. Published by T. Tegg, 111 Cheapside. (245.)&mdash;Buonaparte
is acting as nurse to the rival Spanish claimants, still clad in his
uniform and boots, with the indispensable cocked hat of Brobdingnagian proportions;
the Emperor is lulling the entire royal family to sleep: with one foot he
is rocking the 'Imperial Cradle,' which contains 'The good old King and his
amiable Consort,' while Don Carlos, in swaddling clothes, with a padlock round
his neck, is slumbering upon one of the Corsican's knees; upon the fellow is
held Antonio under similar conditions, while the arch-deceiver is rocking a duplicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_95" id="Page_ii_95">[95]</a></span>
Imperial Cradle containing the unconscious 'Prince of Asturias,' with his
other foot.</p>

<p><i>July 22, 1808.</i> <cite>The Beast as described in the Revelations (Chap. 13),
resembling Napoleon Buonaparte.</cite> Designed by G. Sauler Farnham. Published
by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;The Beast, which has sprung from
Corsica, is drawn with seven heads; the names of Austria, Naples, Holland,
Denmark, Prussia, and Russia are on the respective crowns; the seventh head,
which is of course that of Napoleon, is severed from the trunk, while vomiting
forth flames. The distance shows cities on fire, where the beast has wrought
destruction; on his body are the figures 666, the total of the numerals found in
the name of Napoleon Buonaparte added together, taking <em>a</em> as one, <em>i</em> as ten, <em>t</em> as
a hundred, and so on.</p>

<p>Spain is represented as the champion who has had the courage to make a
stand against the monster. The patriot has crippled the destroyer; the hero is
armed with a sabre of <em>True Spanish Toledo</em>, and is crying, 'True patriotism shall
thus subdue the monstrous beast, and quell the rage of war.' His shield is <em>Catalonia</em>,
a mitre, <em>St. Peter's, Rome</em>, is his helmet; <em>Spanish Patriotism</em> has struck the
decisive blow from his right arm, <em>Asturias</em>; his sword-belt is <em>Madrid</em>; his
legs <em>Cordova</em>; and with his foot, <em>Cadiz</em>, he is strangling a serpent. The fleet of
Admiral Purvis is seen on the seas; Hope, with her anchor, is stooping to catch
the crowns of France, Spain, and Portugal, which have been shaken from the
brow of the smitten beast.</p>

<p><i>August 18, 1808.</i> <cite>From the Desk to the Throne.</cite> <em>A New Quick Step by
Joseph Buonaparte.</em> <em>The Bass by Messrs. Nappy and Tally.</em> Designed by G.
Sauler Farnham. Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;This caricature was
issued to burlesque the astonishing elevation of Joseph Buonaparte to the throne
of Spain, of which, through his brother's ingenuity, he secured a brief and by
no means tranquil possession.</p>

<p>On Napoleon's coronation, his brothers had been created princes, and Joseph
had been made King of Naples before the Spanish intrigue. The caricaturist's
version, though striking, is not literally true. According to the print Joseph
Buonaparte has one foot resting on the rail of the desk at which he lately occupied
a seat, with the other he is endeavouring to touch Madrid on the map of
Spain and Portugal. His pen has fallen from his ear, and he is straining to
clutch the royal regalia of Spain which is above his head. From a paper pinned
to the wall we are informed this remarkable promotion is taking its rise from the
office of a 'public notary, Bayonne.' His fellow-clerks, pausing with their quills
uplifted, to marvel at this sudden flight of ambition, are making various pertinent
observations: 'What a prodigious step for a notary's clerk!' One clerk is exclaiming,
'Why, Joseph, whither art thou going?'&mdash;'Whither?' replies the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_96" id="Page_ii_96">[96]</a></span>
elevated clerk, 'Whither, but to fill my high destiny, and, like my noble
brother, sway the sceptre of another!' His colleagues are adding as riders,
'He must needs go whom the devil drives, and should it cost his neck!'</p>

<p><i>August 21, 1808.</i> <cite>King Joe's Retreat from Madrid.</cite> Woodward del., Rowlandson
sculp. Published by T. Tegg, 111 Cheapside.&mdash;The occupancy of
the Spanish throne has not proved, if we may trust the print, a profitable sinecure
of long duration. King Joseph is rushing away from his new dignity as fast as
his legs will carry him; the crown has slipped off in the flight; the fugitive's
invincible standards and the 'Legions of Honour' are in tatters, but the hands
of the Frenchmen are not empty; king, officers, and troops are all loaded with
bags of plate and bullion. The Spanish soldiers are up in arms; their priests
are encouraging the pursuers, who are firing a volley into the midst of the scared
invaders, while crying 'Stop thieves! stop thieves! they have stolen the plate
from the palace.' Joseph's fears are too much for his self-command; he is
appealing to his great little brother, 'Why don't you stop? the Philistines are
pursuing us.' Napoleon is replying from his carriage, which is tearing away up
hill as fast as his coachman can urge the horses, 'I can't, brother Joe, I am in
a great hurry myself.'</p>

<p><i>August 27, 1808.</i> <cite>King Joe on his Spanish Donkey.</cite> Woodward del., Rowlandson
sculp. Published by T. Tegg, 111 Cheapside.&mdash;King Joe, the new
sovereign, is finding his seat anything but easy, and even his military saddle has
proved a failure; the animal he has had the temerity to mount has become
ungovernable; the usurper is losing his seat; the crown is flying one way, the
sceptre another: 'Bless me, what a restive animal this is! I thought he would
have been as gentle as a French pony, and was as easily managed as an Italian
greyhound!' The Spanish donkey is neighing at a pack of 'Saddle-bags for the
Spaniards,' and his heels are kicking to the winds the various proclamations,
'All found with arms to be shot!' 'No liberty to a Spaniard!' 'The road to
fortune!' 'Joseph, King of Spain!' 'French news!' 'No quarter!' Thumbscrews
for the rebels!'</p>

<p><i>September 12, 1808.</i> <cite>A Spanish Passport to France.</cite> Woodward del.,
Rowlandson sculp. Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;A Spanish don,
dressed in all his ancient splendour, with a huge sombrero hat and feathers, a
long Toledo rapier, and wearing his fierce moustachios turned up to his eyes, is
kicking the French invader to France: '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Va-t'en, Coquin</i>.' The usurper, whose
courage has disappeared, is sneaking off in undissembled terror; he is receiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_97" id="Page_ii_97">[97]</a></span>
the indignities inflicted by the don with abject servility: '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Votre tr&egrave;s humble
serviteur, monsieur</i>.'</p>

<p><i>September 12, 1808.</i> <cite>The Political Butcher, or Spain cutting up Buonaparte,
for the benefit of her neighbours.</cite> Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;The
Spanish don has put on a butcher's apron and sleeves; the body of the late
'disturber of the peace of Europe' is extended on his dissecting board, and the
operator is cutting up the Corsican with professional zeal. The Spaniard is
holding up his enemy's head, and encouraging the other powers, who have come
to take a share in the dismemberment of the Corsican, 'Now, my little fellows,
here are bones for you all to pick. The meat, being just killed, may be somewhat
toughish, but I'll warrant it fresh and high-flavoured. True Corsican veal,
I assure you, you see the head!' The Imperial double-headed eagle of Austria,
is swooping over this morsel: 'I have long wished to strike my talons into that
diabolical headpiece, and now I hope to do it effectually!' The Prussian eagle
is crippled: 'Oh! the delicious morsel for an eagle to pick, but my clipt wings
cannot bear me so high. Cruel Boney! why cut them so short?'</p>

<p>The Italian greyhound is practising a new concerto called, 'If you will not
when you may, when you will it shall be nay.&mdash;The harmony by Spain and
Portugal.' The Danish dog is picking all the flesh left on the arm: 'The
nearer the bone the sweeter the meat; but,' alluding to the presence of England,
'the nearer that Bull, the less I can eat.' The British bull-dog, who has been
enjoying portions of the joints, has started up: 'I should like to have the picking
of that head, for I dare say it is hare-brained!' The Russian bear is indulging
in the luxury of licking the Napoleonic boots, and he is beginning to long for a
taste: 'This licking gives me a mortal inclination to pick a bone, as well as the
rest. But Turkey's a fine garden, and would be a vast acquisition.' Sweden, a
white-coated dog, is giving good counsel to her neighbour: 'Yes, but a bird in
the hand is worth two in the bush!'</p>

<p>The Dutch frog is seated on a cask of Hollands, beside a barrel of 'somniferous
cordial' for King Louis; he is smoking a reflective pipe over his prospects.
'If I were sure matters are as they appear I should like to pick a bone, it is true;
but wisdom bids us doubt, and prudence condemns precipitation, so I'll e'en take
another whiff!'</p>

<p>In the slaughter-house at the rear are shown the carcases of Murat, Dupont,
Junot, and others, suspended by the heels.</p>

<p><i>September 15, 1808.</i> <cite>The Fox and the Grapes.</cite> Woodward del., Rowlandson
sculp. Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;The Corsican fox, who is still
at large, has turned his tail on certain rich vines heavy with ripe Spanish grapes,
which are growing beside fine prolific Portuguese plum-trees. The fox, who
bears Napoleon's head, with his inevitable huge cocked hat, is speciously trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_98" id="Page_ii_98">[98]</a></span>
to convince the Gallic cock that the fruit, which he cannot reach, is not worth
gathering, 'Believe me, my dear doodle-do, you would not like them. I found
them so sour that I absolutely could not touch them!' This excuse is not satisfactory
to the hearer, 'But, my good friend, you promised to bring me home
some Spanish grapes and Portugal plums; where are they?'</p>

<p><i>September 17, 1808.</i> <cite>Prophecy Explained.</cite> '<em>And there are seven kings, five
are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come, and when he cometh he must
continue but a short space.</em> Revelation, chap. 17, v. 10.'&mdash;The fulfilment of
prophecy is pictorially set forth with a completeness which must have been felt
eminently satisfactory: the five kings that have fallen, the crowned monarchs of
Prussia, Bavaria, Holland, Saxony, and Wurtemberg, are all tumbling about in
the 'Slough of Disgrace and Ridicule.' The one that is, is of course 'King
Nap.' The little Emperor, in all his imperial state, robes, crown, orb and sceptre,
is still left standing, but his face wears an apprehensive expression, as he is
gazing on the fate of the one that 'continued but a short space'&mdash;'King Joe,'
to wit, who is driven beyond the Pyrenean Mountains in a state of consternation,
while a fair goddess, the figure of Spanish liberty, floating on the clouds, is depriving
the usurper of the Spanish crown.</p>

<p><i>September 20, 1808.</i> <cite>Napoleon the Little in a Rage with his Great French
Eagle.</cite> Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;Napoleon, in his general's
uniform, with his sword drawn, and bristling with rage up to the tip of his preposterous
feather, is menacing his huge French eagle, which is much larger than
himself; the Imperial crown is on the bird's head, and one of his legs is tied up&mdash;the
results of damages sustained in the recent flight from Spain. It will be remembered
that Joseph Buonaparte evacuated Spain August 1808. Napoleon is
furiously rating his fugitive slave, 'Confusion and destruction! what is this I
see? Did I not command you not to return till you had spread your wing of
victory over the whole Spanish nation?'&mdash;'Ay, it's fine talking, Nap, but if you
had been there, you would not much have liked it; the Spanish cormorants
pursued me in such a manner that they not only disabled one of my legs, but
set me a moulting in such a terrible way that I wonder I had not lost every
feather; besides it got so hot I could not bear it any longer!'</p>

<p><i>September 24, 1808.</i> <cite>A Hard Passage, or Boney Playing Base on the Continent.</cite>
The design suggested by G. Sauler Farnham. Published by R. Ackermann,
101 Strand.&mdash;Buonaparte, with a drum for a seat, and standing on the
map of the Continent, with his foot placed on Spain and Portugal, is trying to
scrape through a difficult piece of music, <cite>Conquest of Spain and Portugal</cite>; the
music book is open on a desk before him. 'Plague take it, I never met with so
difficult a <em>passage</em> before. But if I can once get over the <em>flats</em> we shall do pretty
well, for you see the key will then change to B sharp.' The Russian bear, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_99" id="Page_ii_99">[99]</a></span>
a muzzle on his jaws, is trying to accompany his leader: 'Why, that is natural
enough, brother Boney, though this French horn of yours seems rather out of
order, I think!'</p>

<p>Before taking their hurried departure, the 'Intrusive King' and the French invaders
are helping themselves to the spoils of the Spaniards; 'Joe' is assisting
himself to the regalia; the generals are packing the royal and ecclesiastical plate
of Spain into chests for transport; strong boxes are being filled with bags of
ducats and medals; the troopers are making off with sacks of treasure; the
curtains are torn down; pictures are wrenched from the walls, and such objects
as statues, which cannot be carried away, are ruthlessly destroyed. The French,
it appears, wantonly damaged or burnt all the property which came in their way
when they were unable to carry it off. The wardrobe, carriages, and plunder
from Madrid were retaken by the British army. The numerous carriages, of all
descriptions, and tumbrils so completely blocked the road, and filled the contiguous
fields, it was difficult to pass. The carriages were completely loaded with
baggage, and the miserable animals pushed into deep and wet ditches. The
four-wheeled tumbrils were loaded with ammunition and money; the soldiers got
thousands of dollars and doubloons; it is said that one man alone secured doubloons
to the value of 8,000<i>l.</i> The entire plunder, baggage, money, artillery, and the
supplies of the French army were taken, carriages, animals, and a great many
ladies. Joe always travelled with a suite of the latter, generally beautiful women.
It is said there were ten ladies of his private family with him; those were all
taken; it is said he only escaped with the clothes on his back, having lost his
hat. By way of replenishing his goods and chattels he actually stole the linen,
plate, and clothes from every place he stopped at, until he reached the French
frontier.'</p>

Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;John Bull has arrived to assist the Spaniards. The
national prototype, grasping his cudgel of oak, and surrounded by an array
of stores of his own liberal providing, is addressing friendly encouragements to
the Don: 'My good friend, you see I have brought you clothing for ten
thousand men, <i>viz.</i>, cheese, shoes, stockings, belts, and small clothes, besides arms
and ammunition, and if that won't do I'll bring you Gully and Gregson, and
the Devil is in it if <em>they</em> won't do!'</p>

<p>His new ally is grateful, and especially looks forward to the assistance of the
prize-fighters: 'We thank thee, Johnny, for all thou hast brought, and if thou
canst bring the other two we shall be more obliged to thee!'</p>

reader's own fault if he does not profitably benefit by them. When I have told

ride him, how to ride him out, and, above all, how to ride him home again, if he
is not a complete horseman in the course of ten or a dozen summers, I will

<p class="center small p2">'DIRECTIONS FOR THE ROAD.</p>

<p>'In riding the road, observe in passing a whisky, a phaeton, or a stage-coach,
in short, any carriage where the driver sits on the right hand, to pass it on that
side, he may not see you on the other, and though you may meet with a lash in
the eye, what is the loss of an eye to a leg, or perhaps a neck.</p>

<p>'Take care never to throw your horse down, it is an unlucky trick, and fit only
for boys. Many gentlemen of my acquaintance, and I too, have been thrown
down by our horses; yet I scarce know an instance upon record of a gentleman
throwing his horse down, but many have complained to me of their servants
doing it for them.</p>

<p>'In passing a waggon or any tremendous equipage, should it run pretty near
a bank, and there be a ditch and an open country on the other side, if you are
on business and in a hurry, dash up the bank without hesitation, for should you
take the other side, and your horse shy at the carriage, you may be carried many
hundred yards out of your road, whereas by a little effort of courage you need
only graze the wheel, fly up the bank, and by slipping or tumbling down into the
road again go little or nothing out of your way.</p>

</p>

<p>'"Sir&mdash;I want your advice, and hope you will give it me concerning a horse
I have lately bought, and which does not carry me at all in the same way he did
the man I bought him of. Being recommended to a dealer in Moorfields (who,
I think, is no honester than he ought to be), I went to him and desired to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_104" id="Page_ii_104">[104]</a></span>
into his stable, and so he took me in, with a long whip in his hand, which, he
said, was to wake the horses that might perhaps be asleep, as they were but just
arrived from a long journey, coming fresh from the breeders in the North.
There were some fine-looking geldings, I thought, and I pitched upon one that
I thought would suit me, and so he was saddled, and I desired the dealer to
mount him, and he did, and a very fine figure the gelding cut; and so the people
in the street said, and a decent man in a scratch-wig said the man who rode him
knew how to make the most of him, and so I bought him. But he goes in a
different manner with me, for instead of his capering like a trooper he hangs
down his head and tail, and neither whip nor spur can get him out of a snail's
gallop. And I want to know whether by law I must keep him, as he is certainly
not the horse I took him for, and therefore I ought to have my money again.</p>

<p>'"Sir&mdash;Upon a strict examination of the two pictures by the limner in your

although he does not exhibit quite so much agility under you, or make so
tearing a figure as when mounted by Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, who I am well acquainted with,
and who, you may depend, is as honest a man as any that deals in horseflesh.</p>

<p>'"You could have no right to return the horse if he went no better than one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_105" id="Page_ii_105">[105]</a></span>

<p>'"Sir&mdash;Being informed that you are now at home, and desirous of giving
every information in your power to those who may stand in need of it respecting
their horses, I beg leave to submit my case to you, which, considering how fond
I am of the chase, you must admit to be a lamentable one. Relying, however,
sir, as I do, on your philanthropy (I should more properly say Phillipigy) and
that zeal in the cause which has so long characterised you, I make no doubt but
the small difficulties I now labour under will be soon surmounted.</p>

<p>'"You must know, sir, I am very fond of hunting, and live in as fine a
scenting country as any in the kingdom. The soil is pretty stiff, the leaps large
and frequent, and a great deal of timber to get over. Now, sir, my brown horse
is a very capital hunter, and though he is slow, and I cannot absolutely ride over
the hounds (indeed the country is so enclosed that I do not see so much of them
as I could wish), yet in the end he generally brings me in before the huntsman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_106" id="Page_ii_106">[106]</a></span>
goes home with the dogs. So thus far I have no reason to complain. Now, sir,
my brown horse is a noble leaper, and never gave me a fall in his life that way,
but he has got an awkward trick (though he clears everything with his fore-legs
in capital style) of leaving the other two on the wrong side of the fence, and if
the gate or stile happens to be in a sound state, it is a work of time and trouble
to get his hind-legs over. He clears a ditch finely indeed with two feet, but the
others constantly fall in; that gives me a strange pain in my back like what is
commonly called lumbago, and unless you kindly stand my friend, and instruct
me how I am to bring these hind-legs after me, I fear I shall never get rid of it.
If you please, sir, you may ride him a-hunting yourself any day you will please
to appoint, and you shall be heartily welcome. You will then be better enabled
to give me your advice; you can't have a proper conception of the jerks he will
give you without trying him.</p>

observe, having so fine a notion of leaping, I should be happy if I could be of
any service in assisting you to make his two hind-legs follow the others, but, as
you observe, they seem so very perverse and obstinate that I cherish but small
hopes of prevailing upon them.</p>

<p>'"An hostler has informed me that it is a common trick played upon bagsters
or London riders, when they are not generous to the servants at the inn, for a
wicked boy or two to watch one of them as he turns out of the gateway, and to
pop a bush or stick under his horse's tail, which he instantly brings down upon
the stick, and holds it fast, kicking at the same time at such a rate as to dislodge
the bagman that bestrides him. Here, sir, is a horse that lifts up his hind-legs
without moving his fore ones, and just the reverse, as I may say, of yours, and
perhaps the hint may be acceptable. Suppose, then, when your horse has flown
over a gate or a stile in his old way, with his fore-legs only, you were to dismount
and clap your whip or stick properly under his tail and then mount again, the
putting him in a little motion will set him on his kicking principles in a hurry,
and it's ten to one but, by this means, you get his hind-legs to follow the others.
You will be able, perhaps, to extricate your stick from its place of confinement
when you are up and over (if you are not down), but should you not it is but
sixpence gone. I send you this as a mere surmise; perhaps it may answer,
perhaps not.</p>

<p>'"<span class="smcap">Good Sir</span>,&mdash;I am in great haste, having a great quickness of pulse, and
my bed being now warming, but cannot get into it without first informing you
how fast I came home from market to-night, and upon my old mare, too, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_108" id="Page_ii_108">[108]</a></span>
was always unkind before as to going. But so it happened. The old mare,
that I could never get to go above three miles an hour, as soon as ever I was
up, set off, and the devil couldn't stop her till she got home&mdash;ten miles in about
fifty-eight minutes. I'm in a heat yet. But I have found out her motive, and
now the public may make use of it. I had bought a couple of lobsters to carry
home, had their claws tied up, and put one into each of my great-coat pockets.
Well, the old gentleman in my right pocket (a cunning one, I warrant him)
somehow or other contrived to disengage his hands, and no doubt soon applied
them to the old mare's side, and, I imagine, had got fast hold of a rib by the
time I reached the first mile-stone, for she was mad, I thought, and my hat and
wig were gone in a twinkle. However, when I got off, and had taken a little
breath, I went into the kitchen to unload, but missed one of my lobsters; so I
ran back into the stable, and there was the hero hanging at the old mare's side;
she'd had enough of it, and so stood quiet.</p>

</p>

<p>'"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;You have no doubt heard of a description of Natural Philosophers,
called Pigeon Fanciers, who breed the bird of that name, and all its varieties.
I was once, sir, a member of this community, till growing tired of punters,
tumblers, nuns, croppers, runts, &amp;c., &amp;c., I was resolved to enlarge my ideas, by
extending my researches and abandoning the biped, to obtain a closer acquaintance
with the quadruped. I became a horse-fancier. Being fond of riding, and
daily observing, in my airings to Brentford, a great variety of horses, and a still
greater variety in their motions, I, some years since, set about making a collection
of such as were singular and eccentric in their shapes and actions, and I flatter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_110" id="Page_ii_110">[110]</a></span>
myself no private museum can boast of a more admirable variety than I have
possessed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'"As amongst pigeons, so amongst horses, there are tumblers. The feat is,
however, performed differently, and varies considerably in its effect on the performers.
As the pigeon executes this without anything on its back, so the horse
seldom achieves it without somebody upon his. To the latter, therefore, we
must give the greatest share of merit, who ventures to perform upon a hard road
what the other does only in the air, without even a cloud to brush against. The
one preferring, it seems, the Milky, and the other the Highway.</p>

<p>'"Among horses, I have never discovered a pouter; but I have had a fine
puffer. The noise he made, however, and particularly when at his business, was
not pleasant; and I let a neighbour have him cheap, who had a good three-stall
museum, and a very heavy vehicle to draw; so that in all weathers he might
enjoy the entertainment of his very extraordinary qualifications.</p>

that from very long observation, I find the pigeon is the most expeditious of
the two.</p>

proves 3 to be equal to 4.</p>

<p>'The Doctor dined at the "Crown"; it was dusk when he set out northwards.
I myself saw 3<i>s.</i> charged in his bill for wine; this accounts for his want of observation.
As for the ostler's, I must attribute it to his having been paid beforehand.
The Doctor went off at a spurt pretty much in the manner I have recommended,
and having got clear of the pavement he wished to (what is called)
mend his pace; but his horse was obdurate, and all his influence could not prevail.
The Doctor fancied at times he went oddly, and therefore brought to at
Alconbury, five miles from Huntingdon, and alighted for an examination, when
he discovered that the ostler, through inattention, had buckled up one of the
horse's hind-legs in the surcingle; and to this alone he had to attribute his hobbling
way of going.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_112" id="Page_ii_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<p>'There was an ostler<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> at Barnet who was a moralist, possibly this at Huntingdon
was an experimental philosopher, and thought an old member of the
University the most proper subject to put his experiment in execution. It
certainly answered as far as five miles; but how it would succeed in bringing
horses of different forms together over Newmarket, I am not competent to
determine. It seems as if one might work a lame horse thus and keep his unsound
leg quiet. If this experiment has been repeated it has been in private,
for I have not heard of it; and I much question if it would ever be generally
adopted. When I say <em>generally</em>, no reflection upon general officers. A timid
major, however, might keep his horse in due subjection on a review day by this
method.</p>

t'other day, as I was bringing two pair of stays to Miss Philpot's, at Kentishtown.
I lives, sir, at Finchley; and a-top of Highgate Hill, my horse makes a
kind of slip with his hind feet, do you see, for it was for all the world like a bit
of ice the whole road. I'd nothing for't but to hold fast round his neck, and to
squeeze me elbows in to keep the stays safe; and egad, off we set, and never
stopt till I got to the bottom. He never moved a leg didn't my horse, but slided
promiscuously, as I may say, till he oversate somebody on the road; I was too
flurrisome to see who: and the first body I see'd it was a poor man axing charity
in a hat. My horse must have had a rare bit of bone in his back, and I sit him
as stiff as buckram.</p>

<p><i>December 1, 1808.</i> <cite>Miseries of Human Life</cite> (Plates issued in previous years
and collected in 1808). Designed and etched by T. Rowlandson, and published by
R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;Frontispiece: The title in a frame; below it a gouty
old miser, wrapped in flannel, is being dragged off in his chair by Death, in spite of
his crutch and his struggles to get back to his riches, spread in the strong box, over
which he has lost all control; his heirs in the meantime are helping themselves,
making light of his hoarded savings, and taunting the impotent money-grubber,
who has accumulated riches for them to fling away.</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of Human Life.</cite>&mdash;Introductory dialogue: 'Sickness befriends temperance
by the simplicity of diet which it introduces; it wards off the varied
injuries of the open air by requiring the party to inhale a thousand times over,
the cherishing, equable, and safely treasured atmosphere of a chamber.'</p>

<p>The picture treats all these fanciful advantages from a burlesque point of
view: a sufferer is on his pallet surrounded by all the inconveniences of washing,
cooking, and other domestic arrangements, limited to <em>one apartment</em>, to serve
him as 'kitchen, parlour, and bed-room, and all.'</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of the Country.</cite>&mdash;Following on horseback a slow cart, through an
endless narrow lane, at sunset, when you are already too late, and want all the
help of your own eyes, as well as your horse's feet to carry you safe through the
rest of your unknown way.</p>

<p><cite>More Miseries.</cite>&mdash;'Being overpersuaded to stand up in a country dance,
when you know, or, what is equally bad, conceive that a bear would eclipse
you in grace and agility.' (<i>April 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>Fabricious's Description of the Poets.</cite> Vide 'Gil Blas.'&mdash;'People think that
we often dine with Democritus, and there they are mistaken. There is not
one of my fraternity, not even excepting the makers of Almanacs, who is not
welcome to some good table. As for my own part, there are two families where
I am received with pleasure. I have two covers laid for me every day, one at
the house of a fat director of the farms, to whom I have dedicated a romance,
and the other at the house of a rich citizen, who has the disease of being thought
to entertain wits every day at his table; luckily he is not very delicate in his
choice, and the city furnishes him with great plenty.' (1807.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_120" id="Page_ii_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p><cite>Miseries of Human Life.</cite>&mdash;Struggling through the curse of trying to disentangle
your hair, when by poking curiously about on board of ship it has become
clammed and matted with pitch or tar, far beyond all the powers of the comb.
(1807.)</p>

<p><cite>More Miseries.</cite>&mdash;Having so flaccid a cheek that the parish barber, who
shaves you, is obliged to introduce his thumb into your mouth to give it a
proper projection, cutting his thumb in this position with the razor. (1807.)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of Social Life.</cite>&mdash;Escorting four or five country cousins, on their first
importation into London from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Terra Incognita</i> of England, to the lions, the
waxworks, the monuments, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p><cite>Miseries Miscellaneous.</cite>&mdash;Stepping out of a boat at low water on a slippery
causeway, upon a stone which slides under you, and you descend in the mud up
to the chin. (1807.)</p>

<p><cite>A Stag at Bay, or Conjugal Felicity.</cite> <em>A Romance.</em>&mdash;A matrimonial dispute;
the wife is attacking her spouse incontinently, and he is protecting himself, and
keeping the aggressor at arm's length with a dirty mop.</p>

<p><cite>The Shaver and the Shavee.</cite> H. Bunbury del., Rowlandson sc.</p>

<p><cite>Showing off.</cite>&mdash;A pair of horsemen are endeavouring to put on a sportsmanlike
appearance, which is somewhat disturbed by the restiveness of their steeds;
one rider is slipping off, and the other, while his horse is going down on his
knees in a reverential posture, is flung over the animal's head.</p>

<p><cite>The Production of a Post-House.</cite>&mdash;The stable-door of a post-house is opened,
and a sorry broken-kneed ramshackle horse is trotted out, to the amusement of
the people standing about, and to the horror of a gentleman who has evidently
come for a mount.</p>

<p><cite>Symptoms of Choking.</cite>&mdash;A corpulent individual has suddenly left the dinner-table,
under an impulse to choke; the rest of the company are thrown into such
alarm at his critical situation, that the table-cloth, soup-turreens, wine, decanters,
plates, glasses, and all the service are dragged on to the floor in universal
destruction. (1806.)</p>

<p><a href="#VICAR"><cite>The Enraged Vicar.</cite></a>&mdash;A smaller version of this subject (see <a href="#Page_ii_66">March 1,
1807</a>).</p>

<span class="i0">To see them rattle, howl, and tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Jove, 'twould make a parson swear.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><a href="#SYMPTOMS"><cite>Symptoms of Restiveness.</cite></a>&mdash;The restiveness referred to appears to be nothing
more than a tendency to rest in one spot; a sailor, probably at Portsmouth,
from the view of the sea and shipping, is mounted on a steed which he is vainly
belabouring with a cudgel, while an old hag is banging away at the poor brute
with a long and heavy broom, to the delight of a convivial party, assembled to
drink outside a public-house, within view of the dilemma. (1808.)</p>

</div></div></div>

<p><cite>Miseries of Public Places.</cite>&mdash;After the play, on a raw, wet night, with a party
of ladies, fretting and freezing in the outer lobbies and at the street-doors of the
theatre, among chairmen, barrow-women, yelling linkboys, and other human
refuse, in endless attempts to find out your servant or carriage, which, when
found out at last, cannot be drawn up nearer than a furlong from the door.
(<i>January 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries Miscellaneous.</cite>&mdash;The necessity of sending a verbal message of the
utmost consequence by an ass, who, you plainly perceive, will forget (or rather
has already forgotten) every word you have been saying. (<i>January 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of Reading and Writing.</cite>&mdash;As you are writing drowsily by the fire,
on rousing and recollecting yourself, find your guardian in possession of your
secret thoughts, which he never ceases to upbraid you with. (<i>January 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries Personal.</cite>&mdash;When in the gout receiving the ruinous salutation of
a muscular friend (a sea captain), who, seizing your hand in the first transports
of a sudden meeting, affectionately crumbles your chalky knuckles with the
gripe of a grasping-iron, and then further confirms his regard for you by greeting
your tenderest toe with the stamp of a charger. (<i>January 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of the Country.</cite>&mdash;While you are out with a walking party, after
heavy rains, one shoe suddenly sucked off by the boggy clay, and then, in
making a long and desperate stretch (which fails), with the hope of recovering
it, the other is left in the same predicament. The second stage of ruin is that
of standing, or rather tottering in blank despair, with both bare feet planted
ankle-deep in the quagmire. (<i>January 1, 1806.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of London.</cite>&mdash;Chasing your hat (just blown off in a high wind)
through a muddy street&mdash;a fresh gust always whisking it away at the moment
of seizing it; when you have at last caught it deliberately putting it on, with all
its sins upon your head, amidst the jeers of the populace. (<i>January 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of Travelling.</cite> '<i>O Miserabile mihi.</i>' Published by T. Rowlandson,
Adelphi.&mdash;A restive horse in a gig backing into the windows of a potter's shop;
alarmed at the terrific crash, you become panic-struck, with the perspiration
starting from every pore. (<i>April 12, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of Travelling.</cite>&mdash;Being mounted on a beast who, as soon as you
have watered him on the road, proceeds very coolly to repose himself in the
middle of the pond, without taking you at all into his counsel or paying the
slightest attention to your remonstrances. (1807.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_122" id="Page_ii_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p><cite>Miseries of Social Life.</cite>&mdash;Sitting for hours before a smoky chimney, like a
Hottentot in a kraal; then, just as your sufferings seem at last to be at an end,
puff, puff, whiff, whiff, again, far more furious than ever. Add to this a scolding
wife. (<i>January 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of Social Life.</cite>&mdash;Walking in a wind that cuts to the bone, with a
narrating companion, whose mind and body cannot move at the same time;
or, in other words, who, as he gets on with his stories, thinks it necessary, at
every other sentence, to stand stock-still, face about, and make you do the
same; then, totally regardless of your shivering impatience to push on, refuses to
stir an inch till the whole of his endless thread is fairly wound out. 'Dixit et
adversi stetit ora.' (1807.)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of the Country.</cite>&mdash;Losing your way on foot at night in a storm
of wind and rain, and this immediately after leaving a merry fireside. (1806.)</p>

<p><cite>More Miseries.</cite>&mdash;Being nervous and cross-examined by Mr. Garrow (in a
Law Court). (<i>April 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>More Miseries.</cite>&mdash;Endeavouring to make violent love under the table and
pressing the wrong foot. (<i>April 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>More Miseries.</cite>&mdash;Sitting on a chair which a servant has fractured and put
together the preceding morning, and upon attempting to lean back falling to
the ground before a large party; a country servant bursting into a roar of
laughter. (<i>April 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>More Miseries.</cite>&mdash;Being obliged to kiss a remarkably plain woman at forfeits,
when you engaged in the pastime only with the hope of being able to salute a
lovely young lady, to whom you are particularly attached. (<i>April 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of Travelling.</cite>&mdash;Starting for a long ride, on a dinner engagement,
without a great-coat, in a mist, a mizzle, a drizzle, a rain, a torrent. On arriving
at the house at last, completely drenched, you have to beg the favour of making
yourself look like a full or empty sack, by wearing your host's clothes, he being
either a dwarf or a giant, and you the contrary. (<i>January 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of Games, Sports, &amp;c.</cite>&mdash;In skating, slipping in such a manner that
your legs start off in this unaccommodating posture; from which, however, you
are soon relieved by tumbling forwards on your nose, or backwards on your skull.
Also learning to cut the outside edge on skates that have no edge to cut with&mdash;ice
very rugged. (<i>January 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>More Miseries.</cite>&mdash;In the country, going to a party to dinner, getting very
tipsy, quitting the house in a dark night, and getting upon your horse with
your face towards the tail, and wondering during the few minutes that you
are able to keep your seat, amidst the jeers of your companions, what freak
can have entered the brain of the beast to go backwards. (<i>April 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of the Table.</cite>&mdash;Inviting a friend, whom you know to be particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_123" id="Page_ii_123">[123]</a></span>
fond of the dish, to partake of a fine hare, haunch, &amp;c., which you have endeavoured
to keep exactly to the critical moment, but which is no sooner brought
in than the whole party, with one nose, order it to be taken out. (1807.)</p>

<p><cite>More Miseries.</cite>&mdash;At an inn, going into a bed too short, with a wooden leg,
which you were too fatigued to unstrap, drawing up the living one, going to sleep
with the other sticking out at the bottom, which, when the chambermaid comes
in for the candle, she conceives to be the handle of the warming-pan, which she
has carelessly left in the bed. (<i>April 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>More Miseries.</cite>&mdash;Sending a challenge, requesting a timid friend to attend
you to the field, who, you think, will not fail to acquaint the magistrate of it;
going with honour to the appointed spot, anxiously looking back at every step to
see if the Bow Street officers are coming, without seeing a soul but your antagonist
and the seconds. (<i>April 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries Domestic.</cite>&mdash;Squatting plump on an unsuspected cat in your chair.
(<i>January 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>More Miseries.</cite>&mdash;Being persuaded to put your finger into the cage of a parrot
and to rub its poll, upon an assurance, from its doating mistress, that it is the
most gentle bird in the universe, suddenly feeling the sanguinary effects of its
beak. (<i>April 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>More Miseries.</cite>&mdash;Having a newly-rolled gravel walk, finding some friends
whom you had asked to dine with you amusing themselves before dinner by
drawing each other in your child's chaise, which disastrously stood at the bottom
of the garden, within sight; seeing the narrow wheels cut up the walk most unmercifully,
and being deterred by a false notion of politeness from giving them a
hint to desist. (<i>April 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>Cold Broth and Calamity.</cite>&mdash;A smaller edition of this subject, the disasters
of various parties on the ice, but treated with perfect originality as regards the
various incidents.</p>

<p><cite>Miseries Domestic.</cite>&mdash;Waking in the middle of the night in a state of raging
thirst, eagerly blundering to the washing-stand, and there finding the broad-mouthed
pitcher, which you lift to your lips, so full that, besides amply satisfying
your thirst, it keeps cooling your heated body, and purifying your linen
with the overplus. (<i>1806.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of the Country.</cite> Published by T. Rowlandson, Adelphi.&mdash;Passing
the worst part of a rainy winter in a country so inveterately miry as to imprison
you within your own premises; so that by way of exercise, and to keep
yourself alive, you take to rolling your gravel walks (though already quite
smooth), cutting wood (though you have more logs than enough), working the
dumb-bells, or such other irrational exercise. (<i>April 12, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of the Country.</cite>&mdash;While deeply, delightfully, and, as you hope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_124" id="Page_ii_124">[124]</a></span>
safely engaged at home in the morning, after peremptory orders of denial to all
comers whomsoever, to be suddenly surprised, through the treachery or folly of
your servant, by an inroad from a party of the starched, stupid, cold, idle natives
of a country town, who lay a formal siege (by sap) to your leisure. (<cite>1807.</cite>)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of London.</cite>&mdash;Being a compulsory spectator and auditor of a brawling
and scratching match between two drunken drabs, in consequence of the
sudden influx of company, by whom you are hemmed in a hundred yards
deep in every direction, leaving you no chance of escape till the difference of
sentiment between the ladies is adjusted. Where you stand you are (that is, I was)
closely bounded in front by a barrow of cat's meat, the unutterable contents of
which employ your eyes and nose, while your ear is no less fully engaged by the
Tartarean yell of its driver. (<i>1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of Travelling.</cite>&mdash;On packing up your clothes for a journey, because
your servant is a fool, the burning fever into which you are thrown when, after
all your standing, stamping, kneeling, tugging, and kicking, the lid of your trunk
refuses to approach within a yard of the lock. (<i>1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>More Miseries.</cite> Published by R. Ackermann.&mdash;Being pinned up to a door,
round the neck, by the horns of an enraged overdriven ox. (<i>April 1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of the Country.</cite>&mdash;While on a visit in the Hundred of Essex being
under the necessity of getting dead-drunk every day to save your life. (See
1807, <a href="#Page_ii_78">p. 78</a>.)</p>

<p class="center">Et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas....
</p>

<p><cite>Miseries of Social Life.</cite>&mdash;Dining and passing the whole evening with a party
of fox-hunters, after they have had what they call 'glorious sport;' and, while
you execrate the very name of a hound, being gorged with the <em>crambe recocta</em>
of one chase after another, till you wish the country was underground. (<i>January
1, 1807.</i>)</p>

<p class="center small "><i>With Illustrations by Pugin and Rowlandson.</i></p>

<p class="center small"><span class="smcap">Published by R. Ackermann, Repository of Arts, 101 Strand.</span>
</p>

<p>With reference to the illustrations, which form the principal feature of this
work, we borrow a paragraph from the <span class="locked">'Introduction':&mdash;</span></p>

<p>'The great objection that men fond of the fine arts have hitherto made to
engravings on architectural subjects has been that the buildings and figures have
almost invariably been designed by the same artists. In consequence of this
the figures have been generally neglected, or are of a very inferior cast, and
totally unconnected with the other part of the print; so that we may sometimes
see men and women in English dresses delineated in an English view of an
Italian palace, and Spanish grandees in long cloaks and ladies in veils seated in
one of our own cathedrals.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The dress, we know, is neither new nor rare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But how the powers came it there?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>'To remove these glaring incongruities from the publication, a strict attention
has been paid, not only to the country of the figures introduced in the different
buildings, but to the general air and peculiar carriage, habits, &amp;c., of such
characters as are likely to make up the majority in particular places.</p>

<p>'The architectural part of the subjects that are contained in this work will be
delineated, with the utmost precision and care, by Mr. Pugin, whose uncommon
accuracy and elegant taste have been displayed in former productions. With
respect to the figures, they are from the pencil of Mr. Rowlandson, with whose
professional talents the public are already so well acquainted that it is not necessary
to expatiate on them here. As the following list comprises almost every
variety of character that is found in this great metropolis, there will be ample
scope for the exertion of his abilities; and it will be found that his powers are
not confined to the ludicrous, but that he can vary with his subject, and, wherever
it is necessary, descend</p>

<p>Folding frontispiece.&mdash;A Savoyard with a barrel-organ and a troupe of
dancing dogs; a Frenchman with a dancing bear; a showman dragging about a
dromedary, with a monkey perched on its hump, and pulling the animal's ears.
A bird made to fire off a gun, in the rear of a half-starved individual who is lost
in hungry longing outside the window of an eating-house; while the proprietor is
taunting the famished gazer with a huge round of beef. A cat is torturing a
mouse. A woman is eavesdropping. Another cat is getting a bird out of a cage.
A woman is emptying a vessel over the heads of a crowd gathered round a tussle.
A cat is launched in the air on bladders. A pair of ruffians are racing on donkeys,
and flogging the beasts unmercifully. All these episodes set forth various phases
of the fine art of Tormenting.</p>

<p>1. A old vixen is tormenting a pretty maid, who is in tears: 'Don't cry, child.
You cannot help being handsome; but I assure you I have often wept from my
dreadful apprehensions for you, lest you should come to walk London streets!'</p>

<p>2. A family scene.</p>

<p class="small center">
Train up a child in the way it should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</p>
<p class="rightin2"><span class="smcap">Solomon.</span>
</p>

<p>Two children have strung up a pair of kittens by their tails; the tabbies
are clawing one another in the air. Two boys have tied a saucepan to the tail
of a frightened dog, and a little girl is singeing a cat's whiskers with a brand
from the fire. The father is smoking his pipe and declaring, 'Dear little
innocents, how prettily they amuse themselves!' while the mother is made to
say, 'I love to see children employed!'</p>

<p>3. A husband, with literary tastes, is vainly trying to interest his lady in his
reading: 'Now, my dear, now for the passage; I am sure it will delight you.
Shakespeare, "Tempest," act the fifth. "The cloud-capt towers, the gorgeous
palaces&mdash;&mdash;"' The wife is bouncing up to the bell, although there is a blazing
fire, interrupting the reading with, 'I wonder the girl don't bring the coals, one
might as well sit in an ice house, but I was born to be tormented!'</p>

<p>4. An old curmudgeon is seated in his armchair, a decanter of wine before
him, with a chart of the gold mines of Peru and Mexico at his back; a young
gentleman, who has been unfortunate, is standing before him in an attitude of
despondency, little encouraged by the friendly advice of the hunks whose assistance
he has vainly implored: 'Ah, my young friend, I told you what it would all
come to, but you have brought it all on yourself. I'll not ask you to sit down,
because you seem in a hurry; however, I'll give you my advice: as you say you
are not worth a guinea, I'd advise you to quit London, and purchase a small
estate in the country!'</p>

<p><cite>The Discovery.</cite> Etched by Rowlandson, 1798. Republished, Jan. 1808&ndash;9.</p>

<p><i>January 15, 1809.</i> <cite>The Head of the Family in Good Humour.</cite> Published
by Tegg, Woodward del., Rowlandson sc.&mdash;John Bull, a very giant among a
race of pigmies, is surrounded by the heads of the different states, who are all
hurling out threats against his chances of peace. Napoleon is thundering for
<em>Ships, Colonies, and Commerce</em>. The Muscovite is denouncing: 'Russian vengeance
attend John Bull.' Holland is blustering: 'I'll eternally smoke him.'
Tom Paine is offering this warning: 'Let him tremble at the name of America.'
The other potentates are following up these threats with valedictions of their
own: 'Beware of Prussia;' 'Austria will never pardon him;' 'Spanish fury
overtake him;' and 'Let him beware of Denmark.' John Bull is smiling good-naturedly
at all these empty vapourings: 'Don't make such a riot, you little
noisy brats, all your bustle to me is no more than a storm in a teacup!'</p>

<p><i>January 15, 1809.</i> <cite>The Old Woman's Complaint, or the Greek Alphabet.</cite>
Published by T. Tegg, 111 Cheapside.&mdash;An old country dame has called upon a
pedagogue, with a fanciful grievance, to make respectful complaints against the
dominie's scholars, who, cap in hand, and satchel on back, are making their entrance
into the learned presence, behind their accuser. The schoolmaster, who
wears a red night-cap, and slippers, is made to say: 'Good woman, you are
always making complaints against my scholars; what have they done to offend
you now?' 'Please your honour's worship, they followed me up and down, and
said one to another, <em>at her, beat her, damn her, pelt her!</em> and a great deal more
that I do not recollect.' The young pupils are explaining the old lady's misconception:
'Indeed, sir, we were only repeating our Greek alphabet, in order
to get it quite perfect; what the old woman heard was only <em>Alpha, Beta, Gamma,
Delta</em>, and so on to the conclusion!'</p>

Published by T. Tegg, 67 Cheapside.&mdash;A trim nymph, very fashionably dressed,
is starting on her travels from an hotel, situated, as we recognise, from the notice
on the wall, near Portsmouth Dock. The figure of the promenader is drawn
with care, and is perfectly in Rowlandson's most telling manner; behind the
curled, feathered, and blooming damsel, is an ancient and colossal harridan, bedizened
with showy finery, who is supposed to have launched the fair charmer.
Characteristic glimpses of Portsmouth are given in the background of the picture.</p>

<p><i>March 20, 1809.</i> <a href="#MAD_DOG"><cite>A Mad Dog in a Coffee House.</cite></a> Published by T. Rowlandson,
1 James Street, Adelphi.&mdash;The advent of a nondescript animal, supposititiously
assumed to be a ferocious mad dog, has produced the utmost terror
and confusion amongst the grave frequenters of a mercantile coffee-house, somewhat
after the model of <em>Garraway's</em>. All the city brokers, and pillars of 'change
found therein, are scared out of their sober senses; some, like the little Jew in
the corner, are paralysed with fear; others are trying to creep under the tables;
a few are seeking escape by the door, which they are effectually blocking; and
groups of affrighted fugitives are endeavouring to gain the refuge of the staircase.
A select knot have made for the bar, and are flinging themselves <em>pell-mell</em>
over the counter; the chimney, and similar places of refuge, are eagerly sought;
tables are mounted; comfortable citizens are thrown on their backs, like turtles,
and trodden on, while the pressure of viler bodies above is expressing a stream
of specie from the well-filled pockets of the overthrown. A cat, her tail swollen
to abnormal proportions, is making a frantic rush into the midst of the cowering
poltroons under the table. Rowlandson generally manages to introduce certain
advertisements appropriate to his subjects, and a notice stuck on the wall of the
coffee-house conveys the following piece of shipping intelligence: <em>For the
Brazils, 'The Cerberus,' Captain Pointer. Burden 300 tons. Laying off Barking
Creek. Enquire of Benjamin Bell, Barge Yard, Broker</em>.</p>

<p>1809. <cite>Disappointed Epicures.</cite> Another version of <a href="#MAD_DOG2"><cite>A Mad Dog in a Dining-room</cite></a>.&mdash;In
this case the dog has run between the legs of a man bringing in a
dish of cutlets, which bestrew the carpet; his downfall has in turn overset
another retainer, whose soup tureen has come to grief; the butler, more engaged
in watching the calamities of his fellows, has allowed the 'spruce beer' to escape
in a shower of froth all over the place. The scene is well worked out; over the
door of the dining-room is a picture representing a party of corpulent friars seated
round a refectory board. The faces of the party&mdash;it is a bachelor-dinner in this
instance&mdash;express more annoyance than alarm; they are dejected at the prospect
of a curtailed repast.</p>

<p>1809. <cite><a href="#MAD_DOG2">A Mad Dog in a Dining-room</a>, or Disappointed Epicures.</cite>&mdash;This
print, which has never before been engraved in its present form, is a literal reproduction

in the possession of the present writer. The picture tells its own story so graphically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_133" id="Page_ii_133">[133]</a></span>

</div>

<p><i>April 21, 1809.</i> <cite>The Comforts of Matrimony. A Good Toast.</cite> Published
by Reeve and Jones.&mdash;The picture represents a scene of domestic felicity of the
most touching completeness. The husband is browning a muffin for tea; his
wife's arm is wound round his neck during this delicate operation; his children
are enjoying their peaceful meal; an infant is tranquilly slumbering in the cradle;
and a cat, surrounded by her family of kittens, carries out the unity of the
subject. Another of the series partly published in 1808, in which a rude facsimile
of the original drawings has been attempted, without much success.</p>

<p><cite>The Tables Turned. Miseries of Wedlock.</cite> A pendant to the preceding.&mdash;The
domestic horizon is clouded by storms. The late happy pair are only kept
from demolishing each other by the table placed between them, which is being
wrecked in the struggle. The wife, in a fury, is holding on to her husband's
hair with all her force, while he has a firm grasp of his unfortunate spouse's head,
at which he is aiming a pewter-pot; children, chairs, crockery, cutlery, and food,
are alike devoted to destruction; the infants are frantic, and general misery prevails.
The execution of these subjects is commonplace, and the engraver has
not done justice to the originals.</p>

<p><i>April 29, 1809.</i> <a href="#DEVIL"><cite>Oh! you're a Devil. Get along, do!</cite></a> Published by Reeve
and Jones, 7 Vere Street, New Bond Street.&mdash;A dashing young officer, a gallant
adventurer, probably crippled with debts, and with nothing but his commission
to support his extravagances, is laying ardent siege to the ordinary person of a
rich dowager, fat, <em>not</em> fair, and decidedly forty; indeed, the lady is more than old
enough to be the mother of her insidious admirer, who is probably looking
forward to the possession of the foolish inamorata's fortune to 'whitewash' his
liabilities, and exchange him from one slavery to another; preferring the fetters
of Hymen to the captivity of a debtor's prison. The lady, a vain piece of
antiquated and frivolous vulgarity, is loaded with massive jewellery, which her
hopeful lover no doubt looks forward to melting for his own purposes, after he
has staked the relict's money-bags on the gambling-table; her feathers are profuse,
and she wears a boa of an extinct kind, famous in the annals of contemporary
fashions, known as a <em>rattle-snake</em>.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

Clarke Scandal</cite> (Mrs. Mary Anne Clarke and the Duke of York).&mdash;In order
to make the caricatures, published by Rowlandson, on the Clarke scandal

in condensed form from the writer's 'Life of James Gillray the Caricaturist.'<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

</div>

<p>George the Third's darling son, the favourite Frederick, on whom he doted,
and who was so popular out of doors that he was hailed as 'the soldier's friend'&mdash;a
compliment which no soldier would be likely to utter concerning a commander
who had not taken the right method to render himself the object of general
affection&mdash;began to attract unenviable notoriety at the beginning of 1809. On
January 27 Colonel Wardle charged the Duke with corrupt administration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_136" id="Page_ii_136">[136]</a></span>
of the Half-Pay Fund, the sole control of this provision having been vested in
the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>The produce of the fund arose from the sale of commissions fallen in by the
death or dismissal of officers in the army, and amounts thus realised were applied to
the purchase of commissions for meritorious officers, and other beneficial purposes.</p>

<p>Colonel Wardle stated he should prove that the Duke of York had a mistress,
Mrs. Clarke, living in great splendour in Gloucester Place, from 1803 to 1806.
This lady had a scale of prices for the sale of commissions, and he would lay
before the House Mrs. Clarke's prices and the Regulation prices.</p>



<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>Every sale effected by Mrs. Clarke was a loss to the Half-Pay Fund of the
difference between her price and the Regulation price. He then made a statement
of a list of sales effected by her, the sums paid, the names and ranks of
the officers, a list of exchanges, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Her patronage, it was stated, extended also to ecclesiastics. He moved for
a Committee of the whole House to investigate the subject. The motion was
agreed to, and the witnesses were ordered to be summoned.</p>

<p>On February 1, Mrs. Clarke stood at the bar of the House&mdash;a lovely Tha&iuml;s,
eminently self-possessed, armed with ready wit, and with charms of person and
address which dazzled the gravest members. She contrived to turn all questions
put to her with the object of giving annoyance, or for her degradation, into the
means of exposing the Duke of York, who, it appears, had withdrawn his 'protection,'
stipulating to pay her an annuity of 400<i>l.</i> per annum, which had been
suffered to fall into arrears, and her applications for payment had been met with
threats of the 'pillory' and the 'Bastille.'</p>

<p>Wilberforce, who, as we have seen, had been active in bringing forward the
impeachment of Lord Melville, for corruption in his office, when at the Admiralty,
as far as misappropriation of the Navy Fund was concerned; and Whitbread, who,
as a leader of the Radical Reformers, was foremost in exposing state intrigues
and corruptions at Court&mdash;were active in bringing forward and proving the
case against the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>Wilberforce has made the following entry in his diary, touching the investigation
before the Parliamentary Committee: 'This melancholy business will do
irreparable mischief to public morals, by accustoming the public to hear without
emotion shameless violations of decency. The House examining Mrs. Clarke
for two hours, cross-examining her in the Old Bailey way, she, elegantly dressed,
consummately impudent and very clever, got clearly the better of the tussle.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_137" id="Page_ii_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Two officers who endeavoured to shield their chief during the investigation
by giving evidence contrary to the truth, were committed to Newgate for
equivocation.</p>

<p>After an examination which lasted some while, during which facts damaging
to both sides were elicited, while Mrs. Clarke's allegations remained unshaken
in the main, Colonel Wardle summed up the evidence, and concluded by moving
'that the Duke of York had been guilty of corrupt practices and connivance.
He accordingly prayed for his dismissal from the command of the army.'</p>

<p>Mr. Banks moved an amendment acquitting the Duke of York of personal
corruption, but petitioning the King to remove him for gross irregularities and
negligence.</p>

<p>Mr. Percival moved and carried a resolution absolving the Duke of all personal
corruption or criminal connivance.</p>

<p>It was evident that the resignation of the Commander-in-Chief would alone
stop further proceedings. Wilberforce and his party succeeded in forcing him to
retire from the command of the army, and the inquiry was dropped.</p>

<p>Sir David Dundas succeeded the Duke of York, and after holding the appointment
for two years, resigned, and the Duke was reinstated.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke was not appeased by the results of the parliamentary investigation,
which had, in fact, effected nothing for her, and all for others. These disgraceful
exposures would have been escaped if the Duke had paid her annuity.
Her motives in the matter were of course entirely personal; the public were on
her side, and she made the notoriety serve her purpose. She announced a
<em>Memoir of her Life</em>, and of her transactions with the Duke of York, accompanied
by a series of his letters; these latter would have been eagerly read, the fervid
specimens which came out in the course of the investigation were republished,
versified, and circulated in various forms, to the delight of the public. The
consequences, and the ridicule apprehended from this exposure, effected the
purpose which a mere regard for good faith could not accomplish: negotiations
were opened for the suppression and destruction of these memoirs, which were
said to be actually in print. An indemnity of 7,000<i>l.</i> is believed to have secured
Mrs. Clarke's silence, and the annuity of 400<i>l.</i> was guaranteed her for life. This
outline of the facts will be found substantially followed by the caricaturist's series,
although the details differ in certain respects from over-colouring inseparable
from satirical versions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_138" id="Page_ii_138">[138]</a></span>
Mrs. Clarke<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> stated that she had been under the protection of the Duke of
York since the years 1802 or 1803, but her establishment in Gloucester Place
did not commence till 1804; it consisted of two carriages, eight horses, nine men
servants, &amp;c., to defray the expenses of which the Duke allowed her 2,000<i>l.</i> per
annum, to be paid monthly. That she had also a small establishment at Weybridge;
the house belonged to His Royal Highness. That the sums she received
from the Duke were barely adequate to pay the servants their wages and
liveries; and when she informed him of it, he replied that 'if she were clever,
she would not ask him for money.' That the applications for her interest in
military promotions were very numerous; she mentioned them to His Royal
Highness, who told her which were likely to be successful. At one period she
had a long list of applicants, procured either by Captain Sandon or Mr. Donovan,
which she gave his Royal Highness, who said he would procure the appointments
by degrees; she stated to him at the same time the sums which she should
receive for her interest in procuring them; that the appointment of Mr. Dowler
to the Commissariat was through the influence of the Duke of York, who knew
that she was to receive 1,000<i>l.</i> for it. That two applications were made through
the medium of Mr. Donovan, for promotions in the Church, one for a deanery,
the other a bishopric; and Dr. O'Meara, who expected one of them, applied to
her for a letter of introduction to His Royal Highness. That the Duke was
fully acquainted with the extent of her establishment as he visited her every day;
paid some incidental debts which she had incurred; but, at the time of separation,
had not made any advances of cash for three months, and, in consequence, left
her involved more than 2,000<i>l.</i> in debt. She resided in Gloucester Place about
three years.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_139" id="Page_ii_139">[139]</a></span></p>
<p>Mrs. Clarke also stated that she obtained for Major Shaw the appointment
of Deputy Barrack-Master-General of the Cape of Good Hope, for which he was
to pay her 1,000<i>l.</i>; she, however, only received 500<i>l.</i>, and, on complaining to
His Royal Highness, he warned her to be more careful, and not to suffer herself
to be duped again, adding that he would put Major Shaw on half-pay. Major
Shaw sent her several letters in consequence, complaining of being put upon half-pay,
but she paid no attention to them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke also stated that she had in her service as footman, a young man,
named Samuel Carter; he lived with her about twelve months, and was in the
habit of attending upon her when in company with the Duke of York. She at
length obtained for him a commission in the 16th Foot, by applying to the Duke,
who conversed with him on the occasion. At the time of the investigation he was
a staff officer in the West Indies. Carter was recommended to her by Captain
Sutton, and was indebted to her alone for his commission.</p>

<p>It appeared from later disclosures that this Carter, who was by no means a
person without education, was the natural son of the deceased Captain Sutton, a
most meritorious officer, and a personal friend of the Prince's, and that his son's
appointment was an act of well-deserved benevolence. Carter's age at the date
of his appointment was, according to Mrs. Clarke's account, about eighteen, but
on account of his short stature he looked a mere boy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke was asked whether she intended to abide by the statement of
her having pinned up at the head of the bed a list of the friends whom she wished
to be promoted, and which list the Duke of York took away? She answered
affirmatively, and said that His Royal Highness took it down the second morning,
drew up the curtain, and read it. She afterwards saw it in His Royal Highness's
pocket-book, with scratches through several of the names of those who had been
promoted.</p>

<p>Miss Mary Ann Taylor, who was in the habit of visiting Mrs. Clarke, when
she was under the Duke's protection, very frequently, stated that she heard the
Duke of York speak to Mrs. Clarke about Colonel French's levy, and that what
passed, as nearly as she could recollect, was as follows. 'I am continually
worried by Colonel French. He worries me continually about the levy business,
and is always wanting something more in his own favour.' Turning then to
Mrs. Clarke (Miss T. thinks), he said, 'How does he behave to you, darling?' or
some such kind words as he was wont to use. Mrs. Clarke replied, 'Middling;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_140" id="Page_ii_140">[140]</a></span>
not very well;' on which the Duke said, 'Master French must mind what he is
about, or I shall cut him up and his levy too!'<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Large sums, it is certain, had been supplied by the Duke to his mistress&mdash;upwards
of 5,000<i>l.</i> in notes, and in payments to tradesmen for wine, furniture, and
a variety of articles, to the amount, in the whole, of between 16,000<i>l.</i> and 17,000<i>l.</i>,
and all within the space of little more than two years. The extent of Mrs.
Clarke's debts was likewise to be considered.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><cite>Mrs. Clarke's Memoirs.</cite>&mdash;Mrs. Clarke called on Sir Richard Phillips for the
purpose of making some arrangement respecting the publication of her <em>Memoirs</em>;
this offer was declined for several reasons of a private and political nature: the
unqualified reproaches to which Sir Richard Phillips had lately been exposed
had probably taught him some lessons of reserve, or at least he did not choose to
expose himself to public notice as the publisher of a work which was likely to
create much political interest, at least while the novelty of the thing lasted.
Though this gentleman declined to become the purchaser of Mrs. Clarke's MS.,
he promised to recommend her to a publisher, who would treat her justly and
liberally. At the same time, Sir Richard told Mrs. Clarke he conceived if she
could obtain the arrears of her annuity from the Duke, and a legal settlement
for the payment of it in future, together with the payment of all debts contracted
during her late connection with His Royal Highness, it would better answer her
purpose to suppress the publication altogether. To this reasonable proposition
Mrs. Clarke consented; negotiations were opened with the Commander-in-Chief's
advisers, and a projected plan of accommodation made known. This was followed
by a string of propositions on the other side, which were drawn up, and
assented to by Mrs. Clarke, and the famous threatened <em>Memoirs</em> of this lady,
'written by herself,' were consigned to the flames on the premises of Mr. Gillet,
the printer, of Salisbury Square.</p>

<p>Eighteen thousand copies, with the perusal of which the country was to have
been indulged, were actually destroyed, and the entire publication was effectually
suppressed. Besides destroying the <em>Memoirs</em> Mrs. Clarke gave up ninety
private letters, containing, it is said, anecdotes of illustrious and noble personages,
of the most curious description.</p>

<p><i>April 29.</i>&mdash;'Mrs. Clarke's <cite>Memoirs</cite> are said to have been suppressed, in consequence
of her receiving 7,000<i>l.</i> down, and an annuity of 400<i>l.</i> for her own life,
and an annuity of 200<i>l.</i> each for her respective daughters, with a promise that her
son shall be provided for. The printer of the work has also received 500<i>l.</i> of
the indemnification money.'<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to discriminate between the alleged motives of Colonel Wardle's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_141" id="Page_ii_141">[141]</a></span>
action and his real object; public spirit was the mainspring which directed the
mover of the investigation, if we may trust his own account, and for awhile the
populace seems to have been of the same opinion, as addresses of thanks from
various corporations acknowledged his patriotism. Somewhat later his disinterestedness
began to be questioned; then the ugly evidence of the house at
Westbourne Place was found difficult to argue away.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The absence of Major
Dodd and Mr. Glennie at the action&mdash;where their presence was of the utmost
importance&mdash;brought against the Colonel by one Wright, an upholsterer, to recover
the expenses of furnishing this house, looked suspicious; the evidence was
against the plaintiff, and Wardle was cast in the suit, and had to pay 2,000<i>l.</i> and
costs.</p>

<p>In the course of the trial it began to be hinted that the chief instigator of
these proceedings was no less than a royal Duke, the brother of the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>It seems tolerably clear, on sifting the motives of the several actors and puppets
in this matter, who had personally nothing to gain by the Duke's dismissal, and
who were obviously, with one or two exceptions, corrupt agents in the first instance
by their own confessions, and therefore likely to be actuated by no higher
principles in the proceedings at issue, that they were (involuntarily in some cases)
exposing their own misdeeds to forward the purpose of a greater personage, who
did not appear, but to whose influence and purse they looked for their reward.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke was, as everyone recognised, acting from the common impulse of
personal aggrandisement, and she frankly acknowledged her principles. The
year following the investigation, and the destruction of her <i>Memoirs</i>, she
thought proper to revenge the want of faith which, according to her account, had
characterised the proceedings of the 'conspirators' in her own case, by exposing
the true intentions of the Duke's assailants; her motives, as she admitted, were
in this second exposure prompted by the same interested spirit which had
actuated the previous prosecution of her late friend and protector.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_142" id="Page_ii_142">[142]</a></span></p>
<p>According to her account Colonel Wardle was simply a tool in the hands of
the Duke of Kent; his allies were Major Dodd and Mr. Glennie, the former
being the Duke of Kent's secretary&mdash;who engaged himself without scruple to
forward the projects of his employer. According to all accounts Colonel
Wardle had bribed the assistance of an ambitious woman who fancied herself
aggrieved, and who was, above all, amenable to sordid incentives: the Duke
had left her in debt, had broken his word in more than one instance, and had
used threats of the pillory and the Bastille in reply to her applications; she was
tired of living in obscure retirement, and was irritated by the menaces of
creditors, whose demands she had no means of satisfying. The chief temptation
held out to her was, however, a promise that she should once more enjoy
that command of ease, and power of shining in the world of fashion, which had
been Mrs. Clarke's weakness through life. The arrears she claimed were to be
made up, her debts were to be paid, the allowance she sought from the Duke of
York (400<i>l</i>. per annum), was to be doubled by his brother; she was to have a
carriage and four, with a residence and state in proportion; and she was to
exercise her own taste in furnishing a house with the elegance and splendour
which had marked her late establishment at Gloucester Place. To do the lady
justice, she hesitated before inflicting the grave injuries which must attend the
public exposure of her whilom benefactor, although she was by no means habitually
given to sentimentality. She wrote to the Commander-in-Chief, asked for
the allowance which, as she avowed, she had done nothing to forfeit, and at the
same time mentioned the overtures which two factions were making her: one
party for political purposes&mdash;the Radical Reformers to wit, headed by Sir
Francis Burdett (who she declared had proposed to treat for the papers and
letters in her possession, some sixty of which, as she informed the Duke, were
in his own handwriting); the other influence brought to bear on her was of a
more subtle and covert description, and she went so far as to indicate the
disastrous consequences to himself which would inevitably follow if she lent
herself to the schemes of his personal antagonists.</p>

<p>The Duke of York remained obdurate, and thus played into the hands
of his personal and political enemies. Colonel Wardle seized the opportunity.
He gave Mrs. Clarke 100<i>l</i>. for present necessities, to induce reliance in
those liberal promises which were later repudiated. The lady's natural
sagacity, and her experience of life, furnished her with strategic abilities almost
equal to the combined talents of the respective factions between which she
found herself; and on the strength of the assistance which she finally consented
to afford to Colonel Wardle and his supporters through Major Dodd&mdash;who,
though less seen, was the more active agent in organising the attack on the
Commander-in-Chief&mdash;she secured the house in Westbourne Place as an earnest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_143" id="Page_ii_143">[143]</a></span>
of the benefits she was to receive hereafter, and succeeded in making Colonel
Wardle become security for the furniture. In her disappointment it must have
proved at least somewhat of a consolation to have out-man&oelig;uvred the Colonel;
who, for his reward, reaped in the end the obloquy attending exposure and
ridicule instead of the glorification which at first appeared likely to crown his
exertions. Thus the combination was successfully set in motion, and, in spite of
all its discordant elements, compelled to work with something like consistent
unison, or its individual members were left to take the consequences of any
attempted retrogression, as in the instances of Captain Sandon (Mrs. Clarke's ally),
on the one hand, and General Clavering,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> whose sympathies were with his chief,
on the other. The opponents of the Duke of York were thus prepared to open
the campaign in the manner we have seen.</p>

<p>In 1810 Mrs. Clarke took up her pen to endeavour to prove that the Duke
of York's fall was actually brought about by the successful ingenuity and
masterly tactics of his brother the Duke of Kent. In a pamphlet entitled <cite>The
Rival Princes</cite> she argued there was feud between the two Dukes, a fact which
was sufficiently accepted out of doors, before the appearance of her publication,
and that of the refutation which followed it under the title of <cite>The Rival Dukes</cite>.
It will be remembered that early in 1802 the Duke of Kent obtained the governorship
of Gibraltar, and that when possessed of the supreme command he determined
to introduce all the rigour of German discipline, in accordance with the
school in which he had received his military education. His efforts to remodel
the existing regulations, and to substitute a system of severer subordination and
rigid restraint, were not attended with auspicious results; on the contrary, a
mutiny took place, December 24, 1803, in which, it is said, the Governor's life
was actually aimed at. On this occasion several officers distinguished themselves
by their zeal and activity; while the timely arrival of a detachment of artillery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_144" id="Page_ii_144">[144]</a></span>
under Captain Dodd, not only endeared that officer to his royal highness through
the remainder of his life, but contributed not a little to restore order in the
garrison. The Duke of Kent was soon after recalled, and although he requested
that the Commander-in-Chief should hold a court-martial on his conduct, the
Duke of York declined to sanction the proceedings&mdash;Mrs. Clarke alleged out of
fraternal kindness, as he declared to her, that if he had acceded to his brother's
wishes, the Duke of Kent would certainly have been dismissed, which would
have resulted in the loss of his emoluments, and this would have occasioned a
reduction of some 2,000<i>l.</i> per annum in his income, at a time too when he was
in sufficiently straitened circumstances.</p>

<p>From the date of his return his royal highness remained unemployed, and all
efforts to obtain a restoration to his governorship, or attain any command in the
army, proved unavailing, although he had received the baton of a field-marshal
in 1805.</p>

<p>Between the Commander-in-Chief and his brother a jealousy had for some
time subsisted, and Mrs. Clarke did not hesitate to state that the intrigue to
which she had been induced to lend herself as the most conspicuous figure, was
prompted by a desire on the part of the principal agitator&mdash;who remained discreetly
in the background&mdash;to humiliate the Duke of York, in the expectation
that the office of Commander-in-Chief, vacated by his brother's dismissal, would
descend on himself in the natural order of things: an expectation which was not
realised. One wild surmise attributed to 'the party' the belief that the Duke of
York, smarting under his disgrace, would commit suicide, and thus afford the
Duke of Kent a chance of being appointed his successor, as in the event of his
brother's decease, there seems little doubt that the Duke of Kent, in spite of
certain prejudices against which he struggled through his prematurely closed life,
would have filled the office, almost by family right. The character of the Duke
of Kent has been dispassionately reviewed since that date, and the calumnies of
his detractors disallowed; beyond a natural leaning to discipline pushed to
severity, through the fruits of his training, it is clear that his disposition was
remarkably free from the guilty personal weaknesses which marked his age, and
from those unrestrained self-indulgences which disfigured many of the brightest
luminaries of the last century in nearly every phase of society.</p>

<p>It will perhaps be interesting, after having thus attempted to trace the involutions
of this complicated and scandalous intrigue, which, however, belongs to
history, to add a word on the ultimate careers of the principal actors. Mrs. Clarke
chiefly spent her later years in Paris, where it is understood she died, leaving a
fortune amounting to some thousands of pounds. It is a redeeming point in her
character, that when a certain nobleman (best known by the fictitious title of the
'Marquis of Steyne,' under which he figures in a famous novel, perhaps the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_145" id="Page_ii_145">[145]</a></span>
finest in the world), presuming on the reputation of the mother, made princely
overtures, with the object of converting one of her daughters&mdash;who, we are informed,
were unusually handsome young ladies&mdash;into his mistress, the proposal
was treated with the indignation its nature merited.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke, who was by no means the sinner, according to another account
which has reached us, that his detractors have painted, became for a time, as
we learn, a Brother of the Charter House. He lived to a very venerable age; and
he, too, from the circumstances of his family, was able to leave some property at
his decease.</p>

<p>The majority of caricatures published by Rowlandson in 1809 relate, as we
have already said, to the Clarke Scandal. The exposures which attended this connection,
and the action taken by the members of the Opposition in consequence
of the disclosures of abuses of influence which came out in course of the investigation,
occasioned the Duke of York to resign his office as head of the army, a
temporary concession rendered unavoidable, it appeared, under the circumstances.
The satirical prints put forth to hold up to ridicule the various compromising
revelations which marked the progress of the Parliamentary examination of
witnesses formed a series by themselves. Thomas Tegg who issued the greater
part of these plates, thought proper to bring out a frontispiece or title-page to
the collection, which our artist etched, for the purpose, on March 27, 1809.
The design of this introductory print is arranged as a screen, on which is the
lettering: '<em>Tegg's complete Collection of Caricatures relative to Mrs. Clarke, and
the circumstances arising from the Investigation of the Conduct of His Royal

were especially playful, as succeeding prints will elucidate. Mrs. Clarke is seen,
standing in semi-royal state, under a canopy, and holding a levee of interested
applicants: military officers, of various grades, are bowing before the fair patroness;
a Church dignitary, openly provided with the needful (800<i>l.</i> in a money-bag),

such delicate transactions as Mrs. Clarke carried on at Gloucester Place, where
the Duke had set up an elegant establishment for her use, the intermediary of
third parties was essential. Among the accommodating persons whose names
were brought to light in the course of the proceedings, as acting in the capacity
of 'go-betweens,' was a certain 'Emperor of Morocco,' as he was styled in the
correspondence, but who, in sober reality, was a ladies' shoemaker, one Taylor,
of Bond Street.</p>

<p>The print represents this mysterious plenipotentiary, with private correspondence
in his hand, hurrying up to Mrs. Clarke's handsomely furnished
mansion; the lady, who is at the open window on the look-out for her envoy,
is crying, 'Open the door, John; here comes the Ambassador. Now for the
dear delightful answer.' John Bull, with his dog by his side, who has apparently
formed a suspicion of the Emperor's errand, is enquiring, 'I say, Master Shoemaker,
where be you going in such a woundy hurry?' To which the bustling
confidential agent replies, 'Don't speak to me, fellow; you should never pry into

in Mrs. Clarke's drawing-room; a round table is covered with wines, spirits,
punchbowls, and, among the rich dessert dishes, is a gigantic golden bowl, the
thankoffering of a Bishop. The diversions of the company assembled have
passed the bounds of innocent recreation; fiddlers and singers are rolling on the
floor, wine and punch are recklessly thrown about the place, and altogether the
spectacle is not of an improving character. A troop of flunkeys, in expensive
liveries, are helping themselves from the decanters and laughing at the tipsy
antics of the company.</p>

most affectionate epistles were dated from Weymouth, and the caricaturist has
drawn the stout commander seated at table there, pen in hand, filled with rapture
at the prospect of returning to his Delilah: 'To-morrow I inspect my regiment,
and then for my dearest, dearest, dearest love!' Unfinished love-letters are
scattered around: 'Oh, love is the cause of my folly!' 'My amiable girl!' 'My
dearest dear, I hope to be in your arms,' &amp;c. The Duke's black footboy, who

to moralise over the Duke's follies: 'Bless my massa! what be the matter with

<p><i>February 26, 1809.</i> <cite>An Unexpected Meeting.</cite>&mdash;An elderly officer is amazed
at running across the figure of Mrs. Clarke's footboy, strutting in his uniform as
bold as the best. 'Can I believe my eyes? Why, this is the little footboy who
waited on us at the house of a lady of a certain description!' The promoted
favourite is highly indignant at this allusion to the past: 'I beg, sir, you will not
come for to go to affront a gemman!'</p>

<p><i>February 26, 1809.</i> <cite>The Bishop and his Clarke.</cite> Published by T. Tegg,
111 Cheapside.&mdash;The reverend Bishop of Osnabr&uuml;ck has laid aside his crozier
and mitre and assumed the nightcap of domestic retirement. By his side is the
notorious Clarke, who is reminding her companion of certain promises: 'Only
remember the promotions I mentioned; I have pinned up the <em>list</em> at the head
of the bed.' To which the Duke of York is tenderly responding, 'Ask anything
in reason, and you shall have it, my dearest love!' The list of promotions includes
'A Bishopric for Dr. O'Leary,' 'A Commissariat for Dicky Dowlas,' and
other items, down to a post for the lady's footboy. It was stated by Mrs.
Clarke, during the proceedings, that the Duke had assured her 'that as his
favourite she had far more influence than the Oueen.'</p>

<p><i>February 27, 1809.</i> <cite>A Pilgrimage from Surrey to Gloucester Place, or the
Bishop in an Ecstasy.</cite> Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;The Duke of York, arrayed in
his canonicals as Prince Bishop of Osnabr&uuml;ck, has turned his back on his mansion
and on his wife; he has travelled a long stride upon the 'road to destruction'
and passed the 'stumbling-block' on his path. He is trampling under foot
'Thoughts on Connubial Happiness' and the Commandments, and is just turning
the corner of Gloucester Place, saying, 'Now for a meeting with my dearest
dear.' Mrs. Clarke and a female friend are looking out of window, and signalling
the Duke's arrival. Various placards are pasted on the house of his
mistress: 'To all.&mdash;Journeymen Taylors wanted,' 'Man traps are placed every
night on these premises,' 'Diamonds by Mrs. Clarke, Lapidary to His Highness;'
'Agency Office; business transacted on moderate terms;' 'This evening will be
performed "Duke and no Duke," by His Majesty's servants,' &amp;c.</p>

white beard, fur cap, and robes of a magician; he is waving a magic wand,
'Petticoat Influence,' over Mrs. Clarke's late footboy, who is rising transformed
into a captain, and filled with astonishment at the rapidity of the performance.
The Duke is made to say, 'By the mystery of my art, no more be a footboy,
but rise a captain!'</p>

company, consisting principally of army officers, have been dining; the wine is
on the table. 'Come, Jack, favour with a toast.' The chairman is standing on
his legs to do honour to his toast: 'Here is the lady that can raise five hundred!'
Another gallant gentleman is anxiously enquiring of his neighbour, 'How much
did you give to be gazetted?' The answer, given with a disconsolate air, is,
'Five hundred hard cash!' A listener is remarking, 'I did not think it would
have been done up so soon. I had promised at least a dozen promotions!'</p>

<p><i>March 4, 1809.</i> <cite>Chelsea Parade, or a Croaking Member Surveying the
Inside, Outside, and Backside of Mrs. Clarke's Premises.</cite> Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;The
front door of Mrs. Clarke's establishment, 'Warren Street.' The door is
inscribed, 'Knock, and you shall enter.' A notice-board, hung out sign-fashion,
bears the quotation: 'All the world's a stage, and men and women merely
players. Some play the upper, some the under part, but chief play that most
foreign to their heart.' Colonel Wardle, wrapped in his military cloak, and indicating
discretion, with his finger on his lips, is handing a bag of money to a
waiting-maid and saying, 'You understand me,' to which the favourite is replying
with an assurance 'that the Colonel's business shall be attended to.'
Mrs. Clarke, leaning out of window, is overlooking her visitor and crying,
'Though not in love, enter quick, my guardian angel, my sweet Widdle-Waddle.'
Mr. Croker, ensconced in 'Prospect Place,' opposite, as the 'croaking member,'
spyglass in hand, is surveying the position of affairs from an attic marked,
'Peeping Tom's Observatory;' he is exclaiming, 'Oh, the devil choke her! he's
Waddling in, as I'm a prying Croaker.' A discomfited group of ex-favourites
are hurrying off as quickly as possible. The Duke of York, with mitre and
crozier, a cope worn over his uniform, and bearing a label on his stole: 'Men
have their entrances and their exits,' cries, 'To part with my dear, and not allow
four hundred a year.' His lawyer, Adam, by his side, cries, 'Alas, alas! all flesh
is grass&mdash;so said Adam, my forefather;' and Doctor O'Meara, bringing up the
rear, in great tribulation, is moaning, 'O me, Leary! O me, Leary! who once
made Royalty melt into tears&mdash;am now become a sniveller.'</p>

There is a stampede to gain admission&mdash;officers, dandies, old fogeys, parsons with
money-bags, fathers and sons&mdash;the halt and the lame, the gouty and disabled, are
all flocking in crowds, ready to pay for the accommodation,&mdash;but in vain. The

Duke of York has turned his sturdy back on his fair enslaver, declaring, 'If I
must march, I must; however, I shall leave my Baggage behind me!' The
principal cause of the exposure may be laid to the Duke's account. He declined,
as has been mentioned, to keep his word in respect to an allowance of four
hundred a year, which, there appears no doubt, he had promised to make the
lady, if her conduct, after his desertion, was such as to merit his approval. Mrs.
Clarke, who is dressed precisely as she appeared at the bar of the House of
Commons,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> is thus reproaching the York deserter: 'O you gay deceiver, to
leave a poor woman without <em>protection</em>!' The storm which was raised during
the enquiry into the abuses of privilege in the administration of the army and
Half-Pay Fund, and threatened to deprive the Duke of his office as Commander-in-Chief,
only hardened his resolution to do nothing for this Ariadne, who, however,
to do her justice, showed herself well able to defend her own interests, and
to pay back her defamers in their own coin.</p>

tremendous roll of papers, which seems to be endless. 'I have a small list

'Weymouth, August 4, 1804.
</p>

<p>'My dear little Angel,&mdash;How can I sufficiently express to my sweetest, my
darling love, the delight which her dear, her pretty letter gave me, or how do
justice to the emotion it excited? Millions and millions of thanks for it, my
angel, and be assured that my heart is wholly sensible of your affection, and that
upon it alone its whole happiness depends.</p>

<p>'I am, however, quite hurt that my love did not go to the Lewes Races; how
kind of her to think of me on that occasion! but I trust she knows me too well
not to be convinced that I cannot bear the idea of adding to those sacrifices
which I am but too sensible that she has made to me.</p>

<p>'News my angel cannot expect from me from hence; though the life led here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_152" id="Page_ii_152">[152]</a></span>
at least in the family I am in, is very hurrying, there is a sameness in it which
affords little subject for a letter; except Lord Chesterfield's family, there is not
a single person besides ourselves I know. Last night we were at the play, which
went off better than the first night.</p>

<p>'Dr. O'Meara called upon me yesterday morning, and delivered me your
letter; he wishes much to preach before Royalty, and if I can put him in the way
of it I will.</p>

<p>'What a time it appears to me already, my darling, since we parted; how
impatiently I look forward to next Wednesday se'night!</p>

<p>'God bless you, my own dear, dear love! I shall miss the post if I add more!
Oh, believe me ever, to my last hour, yours and yours alone.'</p>

<p><i>March 9, 1809.</i> <cite>The Burning Shame.</cite>&mdash;The residence of Mrs. Clarke, at
the corner of Gloucester Place, is made conspicuous to the public by a notification
at one time practised in respect to disreputable vicinities. A man is planted before
the door holding a notice-board, warning the passers-by to 'beware of bad
houses and naughty women;' a couple of watchmen, with their lanterns slung
on the ends of long poles, are throwing a good light on the nature of the case.
A clergyman and an officer, who were evidently coming direct to the establishment
on private ends, are, by this publicity, warned out of danger before their
intention is disclosed to the public.</p>

<p>'How can I sufficiently express to my darling love my thanks for her dear,
dear letter, or the delight which the assurances of her love give me!</p>

<p>'Oh! my angel! do me justice, and be convinced that there never was a woman
adored as you are. Every day, every hour convinces me, more and more, that
my whole happiness depends upon you alone. What a time it appears to be
since we parted, and with what impatience do I look forward to the day after
to-morrow; there are still, however, two whole nights before I clasp my darling
in my arms.</p>

<p>'How happy am I to learn that you are better; I still, however, will not give
up my hopes of the cause of your feeling uncomfortable.</p>

<p>'Clavering is mistaken, my angel, in thinking that any new regiments are to
be raised; it is not intended, only second battalions to the existing corps; you
had better, therefore, tell him so, and that you were sure that there would be no
use in applying for him.</p>

<p>'Ten thousand thanks, my love, for the handkerchiefs, which are delightful;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_153" id="Page_ii_153">[153]</a></span>
and I need not, I trust, assure you of the pleasure I feel in wearing them, and
thinking of the dear hands which made them for me.</p>

<p>'Nothing could be more satisfactory than the tour I have made, and the state
in which I have found everything. The whole of the day before yesterday was
employed in visiting the works at Dover, reviewing the troops there, and examining
the coast as far as this place. From Folkestone I had a very good view
of those of the French Camp.</p>

<p>'Yesterday I first reviewed the Camp here, and afterwards the 14th Light
Dragoons, who are certainly in very fine order; and from thence proceeded to
Brabourne Lees, to see four regiments of Militia; which altogether took me up
near thirteen hours.</p>

<p>'I am now setting off immediately to ride along the coast to Hastings, reviewing
the different corps as I pass, which will take me at least as long.</p>

<p>'Adieu, therefore, my sweetest and dearest love, till the day after to-morrow,
and be assured that to my last hour I shall ever remain your's and your's alone.'</p>

Cheapside.&mdash;Mrs. Clarke's house at the corner of Gloucester Place is again the
subject of caricature. The figure of the Duke of York, in his uniform, with his
back to the spectator, and his face to the wall, is placed on a pedestal for disposal.
A placard, posted on the house, announces: 'The statue on the outside
having been thoroughly repaired and whitewashed, is to be sold by private contract.
For further particulars enquire within.' A bill-poster is sticking up the
following notice on behalf of the publisher: 'Caricature Warehouse, 111 Cheapside.

<p><i>March 13, 1809.</i> <cite>A General Discharge, or the Darling Angel's Finishing
Stroke.</cite> Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;Mrs. Clarke has been making pretty havoc
among the branches of the service. She has drummed out a number of officers
to the tune of the 'Rogue's March;' discomfited generals and prelates, who,
since their intrigues are unmasked, are doing their best to get out of range. As
to the 'Darling Angel's' redoubtable opponent, the Commander-in-Chief, he
has laid down his cocked-hat and sword, and, on his knees, is trying to mitigate
the excess of mischief which his discarded lady-love is in a position to wreak; he
is crying in despair: 'Alas, alas! for ever ruined and undone; see, see, she has
spiked my Great Gun!' Mrs. Clarke, who is putting the finishing stroke to this
destructive operation, is offering a parting word of gratuitous advice to the now
repentant Commander: 'A wise general should make good his retreat.'</p>

is clad in a complete suit of mail, and he is valorously rushing up to the mouth
of the cavern, whence the Hydra is breaking forth; it must be confessed that
the Champion seems a little staggered at the front displayed by the many-headed
monster; the foremost and most overgrown head is that of the Commander-in-Chief,
begirt with the <em>Collar of Corruption</em>. The other heads are described by
their collars: Dowler, Sandon, Dr. O'Meara, Dr. Donovan, Mrs. Clarke, and
Master Carter.</p>

<p><i>March 17, 1809.</i> <cite>The Parson and the Clarke.</cite> Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;Dr.
O'Meara is favoured with a private interview, of a strictly business-like
character, by Mrs. Clarke. The ambitious divine is throwing up his head in such
raptures that he has jerked off his learned wig: 'Oh how I should like to preach
before Royalty!' The fair dispenser of patronage, with a long roll of 'Army
preferments' and a shorter list of 'Church preferments' before her, is putting the
case in a matter-of-fact way: 'Only pay the Clarke's fees, and the business is
done.'</p>

<p><i>March 19, 1809.</i> <cite>Samson Asleep on the Lap of Delilah.</cite> Published by T.
Tegg.&mdash;The Duke of York is following the example of the famous slayer of
Philistines. He is sunk in slumber, with his head on the lap of his treacherous
Delilah; a pile of love-letters, addressed to his 'dearest dear,' are sufficiently
indicative of his infatuation. Mrs. Clarke, who is represented in the print as a
by no means repulsive-looking temptress, has taken advantage of the hero's unconsciousness
to chop off his full pigtail, and she is holding up the severed
caudal appendage, as an encouragement to the enemies of the helpless Commander-in-Chief
to take advantage of their opportunity: 'Gentlemen, you may
now take him with safety, his strength is gone; I have cut off his regulation tail,
and there is no danger!'</p>

<p><i>March 24, 1809.</i> <cite>The Resignation, or John Bull overwhelmed with Grief.</cite>
Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;The departing Commander-in-Chief, in his regimentals,
as he is invariably represented, is trying to harrow John Bull's sympathies before
he deprives him of his valuable services: 'Good bye, Johnny; I am going to
resign; but don't take it so much to heart; perhaps I may very soon come back
again!'<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

the approaching bereavement; but, although he is concealing his face with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_155" id="Page_ii_155">[155]</a></span>

equivocally in reply: 'O dunna, dunna go! it will break my heart to part
with you&mdash;you be such a desperate moral character!'</p>

<p><i>March 24, 1809.</i> <cite>The Prodigal Son's Resignation.</cite>&mdash;The stout sinner is
humbling himself before the throne. A portion of the King's figure is concealed;
the Duke of York has laid his <em>Resignation</em>, together with his coat, sword, and
cocked-hat, at the paternal feet, and, kneeling in his denuded state, he is quoting
the words of the parable of the Prodigal Son: 'Father, I have sinned before
thee, and I am no longer worthy to be called thy son.' The monarch, who seems
deeply affected by the spectacle of his favourite son's abasement, is returning:
'Very naughty boy! very naughty boy indeed! However, I forgive you; but
don't do so any more.'</p>

<p><i>March 29, 1809.</i> <cite>Mrs. Clarke's Last Effort.</cite> Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;The
delicate investigation being concluded, the fair mover, Mrs. Clarke, was, as the
satirists suggested, left without occupation; and Rowlandson has accordingly
represented that she might employ her talents to advantage in opening an inn a
little way out of town; she is pictured as the landlady of <em>Clarke &amp; Co's Original
Tavern, from the York Hotel, London</em>. Members of the Army, the Church, a
Quaker, and others are hurrying up to extend their patronage to the new establishment.

robes, is passing through an enthusiastic crowd; the charioteer is declaring: 'I
thought we should bring him through.' The Duke of York is in the boot, apparently,
'blowing his own trumpet;' a placard, wreathed in laurel, is on the
roof of the carriage, announcing, <em>Acquitted</em>. <em>Glorious majority of 82.</em></p>

<p>The people are uproariously demonstrative; they are shouting: 'Huzza!
glorious news for Old England!' females are encouraging their husbands to
cheer; the figure of Mrs. Clarke is represented bursting through the multitude
and shaking her fists at her late 'protector,' while a stout Churchman by her side
is loyally protesting, 'I always said he was innocent!'</p>

home to his comely spouse and family in such an elated frame of mind&mdash;skipping
about, to the derangement of his ecclesiastic dignity, and losing his wig
and hat&mdash;that his wife is enquiring: 'Why, my dear, you are quite frantic; what
is the matter with you?' The Doctor is replying, in ecstasy, jumping higher
than ever: 'Frantic?&mdash;I believe I am&mdash;I have been preaching before Royalty&mdash;our

and throughout the series of satirical prints which Rowlandson designed on the
<em>Delicate Enquiry</em>, are drawn up on the stage, in proper theatrical fashion, to
acknowledge the gratifying reception accorded their exertions at the hands of an
appreciative public. The national prototype, as the paying patron of the performance,
is in the stage box, clapping his hands with enthusiasm, and shouting,
'Bravo, bravo!' Mrs. Clarke, as the leading actress, is standing in front of the
line of players, dressed in semi-martial fashion, with a military hat on her head,
epaulettes, a gorget, a laced coat, and a crimson sash. She is speaking the
farewell address, which is as follows:&mdash;'Ladies and Gentlemen,&mdash;Having done
our duty as far as we were called upon, we most humbly take our leave of a
generous audience; not, like the generality of actors, wishing for a repetition of
the performance, but, on the contrary, that it may never again be repeated. As
to our friend Mr. Tegg, we hope that the graphic illustrations of this drama,
which he and his performers have brought forward, may meet with that encouragement
which is never denied to the effusions of whim and humour by a
loyal and liberal British public; but I particularly request that, while you acquit
the Bishop, you will be merciful to his Clarke.'</p>

of turpitude are grouped together to form a memorial suited to the occasion.
The foundation-stone is a huge block, labelled 'York Folly,' supported on one
side by the Episcopal mitre and crozier of the Right Rev. Bishop of Osnabr&uuml;ck,
with a scroll of 'The New Morality.' The accessories on the other side are the
cocked-hat, sword, and tender love-letters of the ex-Commander-in-Chief. A
block of 'Cracked Portland Stone,' and a third slab of 'Folkestone of the first
quality,' refer to the agitations raised by the Duke of Portland and Lord Folkestone;
the more spirited elements are ranged above this foundation, in the form
of a barrel of 'Whitbread's Entire,' 'Burdett's Stingo,' and 'Wardle's British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_157" id="Page_ii_157">[157]</a></span>

corruption.</p>

'Mouldy and Rotten.' A sinister blast from a diabolical agent is withering the
plant, and the leaves are falling; they are labelled with various uncomplimentary
sentences, suggesting all kinds of vices, belonging to the parent shoot. Below
this unflattering tribute to the Alderman is inscribed the following parody of

<p><i>April 10, 1809.</i> <cite>The Modern Babel, or Giants Crushed by a Weight of
Evidence.</cite> Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;The unfortunate Duke of York, with his
Counsel and learned supporters, are crushed down under the weight of a compound
structure which has been imposed upon their heads and shoulders. The
bulkiest mass is the <em>Evidence of Mrs. Clarke</em>; <em>Miss Taylor's Evidence</em> is next in
consequence, and the pyramidal slabs decrease upwards: <em>Sly hits from Sandon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_158" id="Page_ii_158">[158]</a></span>
and Clavering</em>; <em>Home Strokes from Dowling</em>; <em>Mrs. Hovendon's Evidence</em>; <em>Mrs.
Tavery, Doctor O'Meara, Master Carter</em>, &amp;c. The person of Mrs. Clarke,
posed in a triumphant attitude, is the figure which completes this superstructure
of folly.</p>

<p><i>April 18, 1809.</i> <cite>The Sick Lion and the Asses.</cite> Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;The
Duke of York's head is placed on the shoulders of the disabled forest king,
a pair of asses are showing their heels to the royal beast. 'What a <em>Cur it is</em>!'
and 'Every man has his <em>Price</em>,' written on their collars, proclaim the identity of
these animals. Another ass, of deeper cunning, forbears to take advantage of
the prostrate lion, from far-seeing motives: 'Pshaw, pshaw! don't be afraid, I
shall not kick, you may depend upon me&mdash;you may be of service to me hereafter!'</p>

<p>The apologue is said to be 'taken from Mr. Waithman's speech at the Common
Hall:' 'When the royal beast was sick to death, and unable to defend himself,
the minor beasts he had injured came to revile him with their wrongs; but when
the dull asses came to fling their heels at him the royal animal exclaimed: "Injuries
from others I can bear with resignation, but to bear insult from such vile
animals as asses is to die a hundred deaths!"'</p>

<p><i>April 21, 1809.</i> <cite>Burning the Books.</cite> Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;As we have
traced in the summary of the diversified proceedings in the Clarke Scandal, the
friends of the Duke of York were glad, as a last resource, to make terms with
the enemy; and the conditions under which Mrs. Clarke's silence was purchased
being published abroad (considering the publicity of the circumstances attending
the <em>Investigation</em>, the terms of surrender could not be disguised), the satirists
made merry over this fresh instance of tergiversation.</p>

<p>The edition of Mrs. Clarke's memoirs, the bombshell which threatened the
aristocratic peace of mind, was purchased for a certain sum. In the print of
'Burning the Books' the heroine of the scandal is holding up the terms of
surrender: '10,000<i>l.</i>, debts paid, 600<i>l.</i> per annum, &amp;c. &amp;c.' The heroine of the
memoirs is directing the destruction of her eagerly-expected volumes, containing
hundreds of letters from persons of quality, including the correspondence (supposed
to have been destroyed) of the Duke of York. The lady is zealous
enough in the interests of her profitable clients: 'Burn away! I would burn half
the universe for the money. You may preserve a copy or two for Doctor
O'Meara and a few private friends. Now for my Brimstone carriage!' The
printer's men are carrying piles of the offending work, and committing the
edition to the flames. An acknowledgment from the publisher is on the writing-table:
'Received for paper and printing, and also for destroying this,' &amp;c. The
figure of the Duke of York is shown, slily peeping from behind a curtain; the
Commander, lately resigned, is evidently delighted at the course things are
taking, and is crying, 'This will do!' Many of the letters, as Mrs. Clarke declared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_159" id="Page_ii_159">[159]</a></span>
reflected in disrespectful terms on the heir to the throne and others of his
royal brothers.</p>

<p><i>April 22, 1809.</i> <cite>A Piece-Offering.</cite> Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;Mrs. Clarke,
in all her extensive finery, is sacrificing her memoirs, <em>Life of Mrs. Clarke</em>, the
Duke's ardent love-letters, and all the disagreeable evidences supposed to have
remained in her possession, at the <em>Altar of Repentance</em>. The figure of the Commander
is rising in effigy above the flames, in the centre of a brilliant sun; his
face is turned to the authoress of the pyre with a satisfied smile. The high-priestess
of the sacrifice is gratefully addressing the mollified divinity: 'Thus
perish all that gives my darling pain!'</p>

<p><i>May 24, 1809.</i> <cite>The Quaker and the Clarke.</cite> Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;A
sedate Quaker, in a suit of modest brown, has turned his back on the beguiling
enchantress, fair authoress of so much mischief, and is hurrying away from her
entreaties 'to tarry a while,' declaring: 'Woman, avaunt! I am not to be tempted;
and be it known also I am a married man,' &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>May 28, 1809.</i> <cite>John Bull and the Genius of Corruption.</cite> Published by T.
Tegg (94).&mdash;The national prototype has been haranguing on the extinction of
abuses with a compound symbolical monster, who is standing in the way of
progress and healthy legislation. Mr. Bull's corrupt opponent is making the
Jesuitical concession: 'What you say about Reform, Johnny, is very true, but
this is not the time for it!' John Bull, who has no opinion of the obstructive
party, is retorting, 'No, nor it never will be while such a monster as you
remains in existence!'</p>

<p>The monster, who is evidently a difficult customer to deal with, wears a
defensive cap of <em>Professions and Promises</em>; he has 'an eye to <em>Interest</em>,' a <em>Mouth
of Guile</em>, and a nose to <em>Scent for Interest</em>; he wears the <em>Collar of Corruption</em>,
has <em>Wings of Speculation</em>, <em>Arms of Power</em>, and <em>Hands of Extortion</em>, and is
further provided with bags of gold for the purpose of bribery, <em>Deep Pockets of
Perquisites</em>, <em>Legs of Luxury</em>, and he is propped on <em>Feet of Connivance</em>.</p>

<p><i>June 12, 1809.</i> <cite>Boney's Broken Bridge.</cite>&mdash;The Austrian army is drawn
up in security on one side of the river Danube; Buonaparte, in a fine rage
with his discomfited generals, and his disappointed legions, are arrayed on the
other bank, powerless to disturb their exulting adversaries. The Emperor is
pointing to the remains of his famous bridge, and furiously demanding, in reply
to the Austrian taunts: 'Ah, who is it that dares contradict me? I say it was
some floating timber and the high swell of the river that caused the shocking
accident!' An impolitic old general, bowing low, and in consternation at the
news he is obliged to impart, is replying: 'With all due deference to your little
Majesty, it was the Austrian fire-boats that destroyed the bridge.' The Archduke's
troops are chanting a new edition of an old nursery <span class="locked">rhyme:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>July 9, 1809.</i> <cite>Hell Broke Loose, or the Devil to Pay among the 'Darling
Angels.'</cite> Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;The dark fiend is standing at the gates of the
infernal regions, scourge in hand; he is dressed in the wig and robes of a judge,
and poised on a slab, setting forth the well-recognised axiom: <em>Two of a trade
can never agree</em>. The diabolical personage is holding the balance between the
two principal actors in the late proceedings. It will be remembered that a misunderstanding
occurred between the chief conspirators. Soon after the conclusion
of the investigation in the House of Commons, Colonel Wardle and Mrs. Clarke
began to exchange mutual recriminations, and the public were gratified with
fresh scandalous revelations; the champion of impartial justice began to lose
his strangely-earned popularity. Colonel Wardle is plunged into the scale of
<em>Patriotism</em>, with an infernal imp to weigh him down; the gold box, in which the
freedoms of more than one town were offered to the enemy of corruption, and
the York <em>impeachment papers</em> are thrown into the scale to make weight. Mrs.
Clarke is balanced against her late coadjutor in the scale of <em>Virtue</em>. 'Love-letters,
Mr. Wright's bill, Doctor Donovan's bill,' &amp;c., are added to weigh against
the Colonel's testimonials.</p>

<p><i>July, 1809.</i> <cite>The Tables are Turned. How are the Mighty Fallen!</cite>&mdash;The
public were treated with the spectacle of the patriotic champion sued in a law
court for the furniture of Mrs. Clarke's house at Westbourne Place, which had
been taken on his guarantee and recommendation. The Court gave judgment
against the crestfallen Colonel, who had denied his liability, and he was adjudged
to pay the heavy expenses incurred in the new establishment and the incidental
costs of the process. In Rowlandson's view of the situation Mrs. Clarke is
seen mounted on her asinine ex-supporter; the head of the steed bears a face
suggestively resembling the countenance of the patriot; a 'Turkey carpet' furnishes
a saddle; the motto <em>England expects every man to do his duty</em> is written on
the bridle; 'Wright, the upholsterer's bill' is tied to the animal's tail; the lady
is whipping up her reluctant supporter with a birch labelled 'Private promises.'
The ass is scattering the chairs, tables, mirrors, fenders, and other objects particularised
on 'the bill' which gave the Colonel so much irritation; the flattering
presentations, addresses, gold boxes, 'Thanks to my ass,' 'Lies against the Duke
of York,' 'Thanks to a Welch Billy Goat,' 'From the City of London,' 'Thanks
and freedom in a gold box,' and other complimentary testimonials, are scattered
on the ground. The dashing rider is making an exhibition of her skilful management
of the donkey <span class="locked">tribe:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>July 14, 1809.</i> <cite>More of the Clarke, or Fresh Accusations.</cite> Published by T.
Tegg.&mdash;Colonel Wardle is exposed to the public in a humiliating position; his
former mob-popularity is reversed, and their admiration is changed to ridicule.
The scene is supposed to take place in front of the mansion in Westbourne
Place, before which is assembled a crowd of jeering spectators. Mrs. Clarke,
unabashed, as in the previous disclosures, is frankly denouncing her ex-colleague,
and pointing to the luxurious fittings of her bedroom. She is unmasking the
scandalised champion to his late friends the mob: 'And Clarke said unto Felix,
Thou art the man;&mdash;behold the furniture! and Felix trembled.' The Colonel,
whose reputation did not improve as the innuendoes of his new opponents became
more daring, with clasped hands and his knees knocking together, is servilely
trying to reinstate his lost reputation: 'Good people of the United Kingdom,
suspend your judgment for the present, till I get this woman placed in the
pillory. I never did anything naughty no more than the child unborn. It was
all for the good of my country, I assure you. I am as firm a patriot as ever
purchased a convex mirror or a red Turkey carpet.'</p>

<p><i>July 16, 1809.</i> <cite>The Plot Thickens, or Diamond Cut Diamond.</cite> Published
by T. Tegg.&mdash;Mrs. Clarke is still in the thick of her complications. She is
standing, unmoved, in the centre of the picture. Colonel Wardle, who soon fell
out with his ally when pushed to fulfil her conditions, is declaring for vengeance:
'I intend to commence an action against her for obtaining money under false
pretences in the case of French's levy. I'll teach her to send gentlemen to
Newgate.' Another individual, dressed as a civilian, recommends: 'Leave her
to me; I'll touch her up in the furniture business!' Mrs. Clarke, with her hands
on her lips, is replying: 'I don't care a fig for any of you; and as to you, Mr.
Furnituremonger, I'll be beforehand with you.' A stout gentleman behind the
fair <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">intriguante</i> cries, 'That's a good girl, follow him up; I'll back you; I'll let
him know whose <em>Wright</em> and whose <em>Wrong</em>. If I don't enter an action against
him I'm no upholsterer.' A young barrister, holding a voluminous brief, is
smiling with satisfaction at the prospect of litigation, and encouraging both sides:
'That's right, my good friends; it's all for the <em>Best</em>!'</p>

<p><i>July 18, 1809.</i> <cite>Amusement for the Recess, or the Devil to Pay amongst the
Furniture.</cite> Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;Colonel Wardle is represented, in an infuriated
state, wreaking vengeance on the offensive furniture, which had caused the
destruction of his popularity and his reputation; the lately immaculate champion
is armed with a bludgeon; he is trampling under foot 'An Essay on Keeping Bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_162" id="Page_ii_162">[162]</a></span>
Company,' and breaking up the elegant belongings of the establishment, for the
privilege of supplying which he had been compelled to pay a sufficiently heavy
penalty; he is made to exclaim: <span class="locked">'D&mdash;&mdash;</span> the furniture, <span class="locked">d&mdash;&mdash;</span> the convex mirrors
and red Turkey carpets; <span class="locked">d&mdash;&mdash;</span> Westbourne Place and everything that belongs to
it.' Mrs. Clarke is rather entertained than dismayed at this spirit of wanton
destructiveness: 'Deary, those little gusts of Welsh passion become you extremely;
the exercise will do you good; besides, it will increase your popularity!'</p>

<p><i>July 30, 1809.</i> <cite>The Bill of Wright's, or the Patriot Alarmed.</cite> Published
by T. Tegg.&mdash;The upholsterer has waited on Colonel Wardle and unrolled his
long bill: 'Gullem Waddle, Esq., to Wright. Red Turkey carpet, convex mirror,
chandeliers, sideboards, bed furniture, chairs and tables, vases and cellarets,
Egyptian furniture, <em>sofa &agrave; la Clarke</em>,' and other weighty items. 'Mr. Gullem
Waddle, I have brought you in a small bill for goods delivered for the Cleopatra
of Westbourne Place; and, as you are a true patriot, you can have no possible
objection to the Bill of Wright's.' The dismayed Colonel, keeping his hands in
his pockets, is making a counter-proposal: 'What do you talk about patriotism?
I tell you I have left off practice. <span class="locked">D&mdash;&mdash;</span> the Bill of Wright's! It is all a
mistake about Westbourne Place; you should have taken it to Gloucester Place&mdash;there
you would be sure to have had your money!'</p>

<p><i>August 1, 1809.</i> <i>Wonders, Wonders, Wonders.</i> Published by T. Tegg.
(101).&mdash;Ten figures of 'Natural Curiosities,' designed and etched by Rowlandson.
A certain amount of care is bestowed on the execution of this plate. The marvels
of the age in which the caricature was published have not, in most cases, become
monotonously plentiful in our own day. As set down by the satirist the ten wonders
were the discoveries of 'A modest woman of quality; a primitive Bishop;
a real maid of five-and-thirty; an exciseman with a conscience; an author with a
second suit of clothes (this fictitious person has been represented in a most
jubilant fashion); a great man of common sense; a woman who has continued
three months a widow; a theatrical hero of modesty and economy; a complete
honest attorney;' and, lastly, 'a man of talents, wit, and learning possessed of a
thousand a year.'</p>

<p>On the close of the Clarke Scandal, which had fitly served the purpose of the
satirist, our caricaturist resumed his series of attacks upon the more memorable
'disturber of the peace of Europe.'</p>

<p><i>August 28, 1809.</i> <cite>The Rising Sun, or a View of the Continent.</cite> Published
by R. Ackermann.&mdash;Buonaparte is surrounded by the Continental Powers; his
present occupation is to lull and rock to slumber, in a cradle, the Russian Bear,
muzzled with French promises, and tempted with 'Turkey wheat.' The Corsican
is figuratively and literally sitting on thorns; the sun of Spain and Portugal is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_163" id="Page_ii_163">[163]</a></span>
arising on the meridian with threatening import. Sweden has taken the part of
watchguard of Freedom, and is raising the cap of liberty; a Swedish huzzar is
making a desperate sabre-cut at the too successful general, and sounding a
warning note to the betrayed Muscovite: 'Awake, thou sluggard, ere the fatal
blow is struck, and thou and thine execrable ally sunk to eternal oblivion.' The
Emperor is disturbed by the new light: 'This rising sun has set me upon thorns.'
The Dutchman, with a broken sceptre, is sunk in a besotted sleep on a cask of
'genuine hollands,' and leaning the weight of his fat person on his ally, who
finds the weight a trifle crushing. Poland is represented as a shadow; the
Prussian eagle is trussed; and the King, with straw in his hair, and confined in
a strait-waistcoat, is singing mad ditties. Denmark is snuffed out under an extinguisher;
but the Austrian Emperor is once more taking heart and advancing
to the attack, sabre in hand, with dangerous intentions: 'Tyrant, I defy thee
and thy cursed crew!'</p>

<p><i>September 3, 1809.</i> <cite>The Pope's Excommunication of Buonaparte, or Napoleon
brought to his last stool.</cite> Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;The Pope and his legates
have called on the Emperor, with candle and bell, to produce an effect. The
head of the Church is propped up on 'French crutches,' and his triple crown is
split asunder; he is declaring: 'He has cracked my crown, overturned my temporal
dignities; but I am so trammelled in these crutches that I cannot follow
him as I would wish; however, my good Lord Cardinals, read him the excommunication&mdash;it
will make him tremble on his throne.' The Cardinals proceed to
rehearse the contents of the comminatory scroll; the Emperor, who is holding
an 'Essay on the Church of Rome,' amongst other waste papers, is returning,
unmoved: 'Mercy on me! I never heard anything half so dreadful. When you
have done with that paper, gentlemen, I will thank you for it!'</p>

<p><i>September 4, 1809.</i> <cite>Song by Commodore Curtis.</cite> <em>Tune, 'Cease, rude Boreas.'</em>
Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;The artist has furnished the heading for a parody
setting forth the adventures of the gallant Curtis, Alderman and Commodore, with
the expedition which was sent to assist our allies the Dutch against the French.
Curtis is seated in his armchair in the cabin of his yacht, a great gold challenge
cup, <em>Speedy and Soon</em>, in his grasp, with a turtle laid on its back by his side. A
party of English officers belonging to the expedition have come on board, and
they are making free with his good things; wine and punch are flowing lavishly.
According to the song-writer's version these gallant warriors, having boarded the
Commodore's yacht and made sad havoc with all his provisions, succeeded, after
a three days' devastation, in eating and drinking all the plentiful supplies laid in
by poor Curtis, until at last he began to dread that they might take it into their
heads to eat him too. Although the worthy cit set out enthusiastically and filled
with valour, his return was somewhat less <span class="locked">heroic:&mdash;</span></p>

of the glorious and never-to-be-forgotten Grand Expedition, so ably
planned and executed in the year 1809.</cite> Published by T. Tegg (107).&mdash;The
bust of General Chatham, crowned with bulrushes, is at the head of this satirical
memorial; monkeys and frogs are grouped on either side, 'French monkeys in
attitudes of derision,' and 'Dutch frogs smoking their pipes in safety.' The shield
represents 'the immortal William Pitt, Earl of Chatham,' obscured in the clouds.
The supporters of the escutcheon are a 'British seaman in the dumps,' and
'John Bull, somewhat gloomy&mdash;but for what it is difficult to guess, after so

<p><i>September 24, 1809.</i> <cite>General Cheathem's marvellous Return from his Exhibition
of Fireworks.</cite> Published by T. Tegg (108).&mdash;The General is returning
from the abortive Walcheren Expedition, mounted on a flying wooden horse,
which, like Don Quixote's and other enchanted steeds, is performing wonders in
the way of discharging rockets; on one side of the General swings a fleet of ships,
'Wooden castles in the air,' balanced by such empty bladders as the 'Walcheren
Expedition,' 'Bereland, plan and fortifications of Flushing,' &amp;c. The glorious
General has taken a pair of Dutch dolls captive, and these are the chief trophies
of his adventure. 'Here I am, my dear Johnny, escaped from fire, water, plague,
pestilence, and famine; my fireworks have given general satisfaction abroad. I
must now couch on a "bed of roses," and hope when I awake to be rewarded
with a pension and dukedom for brilliant services.' Mr. Bull and his lady are
standing on their own shores, deeply impressed with the General's man&oelig;uvres.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_165" id="Page_ii_165">[165]</a></span>
Cries Mrs. Bull, 'Lord, what a man of mettle he is!' John Bull is grasping his
thick stick in a way that looks menacing: 'General Cheathem flying back, as I
foretold, garnished out with drops and Dutch metal. Where is the ten million of
British bullion, you scarecrow? The Sinking Fund suits your talents better than
sinking of ships.' Commodore Curtis, in his yacht, is sailing away from the
'mortality at Flushing,' and shouting in great glee: 'A new contract for mouldy
biscuits. Expeditions for ever. Huzza!'</p>

containing such announcements as 'No theatrical taxation,' 'No intriguing shop,'
'No annual boxes,' 'No Italian singers,' 'None of your Jesuitical tricks, you

being about the colour of a bumper of rubicund cognac brandy which she is
imbibing, probably with a view to hide her sensibility: 'Really, gentlemen, if
you gaze at me in this manner you will put me quite to the blush!'</p>

<p>The artist has given a view of the 'pigeon-holes' at Drury Lane, as the new
gallery in 'the house that Jack built' was derisively christened; the present plate
offers a burlesque representation of the refined parts of the house, taken possession
of by a company more miscellaneous than select. The 'rabbit-hutches,'
at seven shillings, are given up to owls and deaf people; a narrow row below,
in which the space is so confined that it is impossible for the spectators to stand
upright, is held by Irish cabmen, roughs smoking long clay pipes, &amp;c.; below
these, in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boudoirs pour la noblesse</i>, we find the servants of the great, dramdrinking,
hobanobbing, and flirting. The occupants of the rest of the private
boxes are of a ruffianly type; big sticks and publican's pewter measures are
noticeable, besides gentlemen with damaged optics, and without coats; a great
dog, ladies from St. Giles's, and similarly distinguished members of society. A
scene of quarrelling, practical joking, and general uproar is proceeding below.</p>

<p><i>December 23, 1809.</i> <cite>A Peep at the Gas Lights in Pall Mall.</cite> Woodward
del., Rowlandson sc.&mdash;The sketch represents a view of the first thoroughfare
where gas was employed to illuminate the streets. Mr. Ackermann, the publisher,
was one of the earliest to light his Repository with gas, which he manufactured
for the purpose, and was at considerable expense in providing apparatus
and making experiments in improving the process. The sightseers are lost in
wonder and admiration at the novelty of finding gas burning in the streets; the
lamps are arranged in branches of three. A gentleman of fashion is endeavouring
to explain the science of gas-making to an elegant creature on his arm: 'The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_168" id="Page_ii_168">[168]</a></span>
coals being steamed, produce tar or paint for the outside of houses; the smoke
passing through water is deprived of substance, and burns as you see.' An
Irish visitor, who has, uninvited, been attending to this lucid explanation, is
bursting out with 'Arrah, honey, if this man brings fire through water we shall
soon have the Thames and the Liffey burnt down, and all the pretty little
herrings and whales burnt to cinders!' Amongst other wondergazers is a
country farmer, who is exclaiming, 'Wauns, what a main pretty light it be! we
have nothing like it in our country.' A Quaker, his companion, is responding,
'Ay, friend, but it is all vanity; what is this to the inward light?' The more
disreputable members of the community are reflecting that the new light will
expose their depravities and put a stop to their commerce.</p>

<p><i>December, 1809.</i> <cite>Joint Stock Street.</cite> Woodward del., Rowlandson fecit.
Published by T. Tegg (174).&mdash;From this satire it seems that a company-mania
must have raged in 1809, suggestive, in its extravagance, of the days of the
South Sea Bubble. In front of the <em>Hospital for Incurables</em> is a blank wall,
covered with advertisements of various joint-stock enterprises, which are attracting
the attention of the speculative. There is a <em>Doctors' Company</em>, offering incalculable
advantages: 'No charge for emetics, &amp;c.; patent coffins provided on
the shortest notice; no surgeons admitted.' '<em>A Company of Menders</em>, open to
both sexes; wives to mend their husbands, husbands to mend their wives, and
most particularly, everybody to mend themselves.' <em>Company of White-washers.
N.B. No lawyers admitted. More advantages; a new Cabbage and Potatoe Company,
warranted genuine; no cooking required, saves time and trouble.</em> At the
corner of Bubble Alley is the following tempting notice: <em>Peter Puff, manufacturer
of deal boards without knots, from genuine sawdust, &amp;c.</em> And outside
a miserable hovel is the advertisement of <em>Tim Slashem, barber, and perriwig
maker, who has a company in formation of mowers of beards by a new machine,
to shave sixty men in a minute, to comb, oil, and powder their wigs in the bargain</em>.</p>

<p><i>December 24, 1809.</i> <cite>The Bull and Mouth.</cite> Woodward del., Rowlandson sc.
Published by T. Tegg (290).&mdash;A corpulent gentleman, wearing a dressing-gown
and nightcap, is yawning and stretching in his armchair. His huge head and
gaping jaws would furnish forth excellently well a sign for the <em>Bull and Mouth</em>.
By his side stands a handsome and highly developed lady, who is taking advantage
of the sleepiness of her rude monster to slip a <em>billet-doux</em> into the hand
of a military officer, who is waiting in the rear.</p>

<p>1809. <cite>A Glee. How shall we Mortals Spend our Hours? In Love! in
War! in Drinking!</cite> Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;Three figures, represented as
seated at table, with all the appointments and accessories incidental to the
brewing of punch, carry out the spirit of the quotation. The lover, a smart
young buck, in top-boots, is rapturously clasping his hands, after a toast, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_169" id="Page_ii_169">[169]</a></span>
inward contemplation of the perfections of his mistress. An old Commodore
illustrates the idea of a life spent in warfare&mdash;although minus an eye and a leg,
he is tough and hearty, and is seemingly content with his pipe and bowl. The
brutalising results of hours devoted to mere bestial intoxication are realised in
the person of a slovenly and imbecile sot.</p>

<p class="center p2">STERNE'S 'SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY.'</p>

<p class="center small">CALAIS.
</p>

<p><cite>The Coach-yard of Monsieur Dessein's Inn.</cite>&mdash;'This certainly, fair lady,' said
I, raising her hand up a little lightly as I began, 'must be one of Fortune's
whimsical doings: to take two utter strangers by their hands&mdash;of different sexes,
and perhaps from different corners of the globe&mdash;and in one moment place them
together in such a cordial situation as Friendship herself could scarce have
achieved for them, had she projected it for a month.'</p>

<p>'And your reflection upon it shews how much, monsieur, she has embarrassed
you by the adventure.' In saying this she disengaged her hand with a look
which I thought a sufficient commentary upon the text.</p>

<p>The triumphs of a true feminine heart are short upon these discomfitures.
In a very few seconds she laid her hand upon the cuff of my coat, in order to
finish her reply.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I fear, in this interval, I must have made some slight efforts towards a closer
compression of her hand, from a subtle sensation I felt in the palm of my own&mdash;not
as if she was going to withdraw hers, but as if she thought about it&mdash;and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_170" id="Page_ii_170">[170]</a></span>
had infallibly lost it a second time, had not instinct more than reason directed
me to the last resource in these dangers&mdash;to hold it loosely, and in a manner as
if I was every moment going to release it of myself; so she let it continue, till
Monsieur Dessein returned with the key; and in the meantime I set myself to
consider how I should undo the ill impressions which the poor monk's story, in
case he had told it her, must have planted in her breast against me.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="YORICK"></a><img src="images/i_183.jpg" width="600" height="347" alt="" />
<div class="caption">YORICK AND FATHER LORENZO.</div>
</div>

<p><cite>The Snuffbox.</cite>&mdash;The good old monk was within six paces of us, as the idea
of them crossed my mind, and was advancing towards us a little out of the line,
as if uncertain whether he should break in upon us or no. He stopped, however,
as soon as he came up to us, with a world of frankness; and having a horn snuffbox
in his hand, he presented it, open, to me. 'You shall taste mine,' said I,
pulling out my box (which was a small tortoiseshell one), and putting it into his
hand. ''Tis most excellent,' said the monk. 'Then do me the favour,' I replied,
'to accept of the box and all; and, when you take a pinch out of it, sometimes
recollect it was the peace offering of a man who once used you unkindly, but not
from his heart.'</p>

<p>The poor monk blushed as red as scarlet. '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i>' said he, pressing
his hands together, 'you never used me unkindly.' 'I should think,' said the
lady, 'he is not likely.' I blushed in my turn, but from what movements I
leave to the few who feel to analyse. 'Excuse me, madame,' replied I, 'I
treated him most unkindly, and from no provocations.' ''Tis impossible,' said
the lady. 'My God!' cried the monk, with a warmth of asseveration which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_171" id="Page_ii_171">[171]</a></span>
seemed not to belong to him, 'the fault was in me, and in the indiscretion of my
zeal.' The lady opposed it, and I joined with her in maintaining it was impossible
that a spirit so regulated as his could give offence to any.</p>

<p>I knew not that contention could be rendered so sweet and pleasurable a
thing to the nerves as I then felt it. We remained silent, without any sensations
of that foolish pain which takes place when in such a circle you look for ten
minutes in one another's faces without saying a word. Whilst this lasted, the
monk rubbed his horn box upon the sleeve of his tunic; and as soon as it had
acquired a little air of brightness by the friction, he made a low bow and said
'twas too late to say whether it was the weakness or goodness of our tempers
which had involved us in this contest; but be it as it would, he begged we
might exchange boxes. In saying this he presented his to me with one hand
as he took mine from me in the other, and having kissed it, with a stream of
good nature in his eyes, he put it into his bosom&mdash;and took his leave.</p>

<p>I guard this box, as I would the instrumental parts of my religion, to help my
mind on to something better: in truth, I seldom go abroad without it; and oft
and many a time have I called up by it the courteous spirit of its owner to
regulate my own, in the jostlings of the world: they had found full employment
for his, as I learnt from his story, till about the forty-fifth year of his age,
when, upon some military services ill requited, and meeting at the same time a
disappointment in the tenderest of passions, he abandoned the sword and the sex
together, and took sanctuary, not so much in his convent as in himself.</p>

<p>I feel a damp upon my spirits as I am going to add, that in my last return
through Calais, upon enquiring after Father Lorenzo, I heard he had been dead
near three months, and was buried, not in his convent, but, according to his
desire, in a little cemetery belonging to it, about two leagues off. I had a strong
desire to see where they had laid him&mdash;when, upon pulling out his little horn box,
as I sat by his grave, and plucking up a nettle or two at the head of it, which
had no business to grow there, they all struck together so forcibly upon my
affections, that I burst into a flood of tears. But I am as weak as a woman; and
I beg the world not to smile, but pity me.</p>

<p class="center small p2">MONTRIUL.</p>

<p><i>The Bidet.</i>&mdash;When all is ready, and every article is disputed and paid for
in the inn, unless you are a little soured by the adventure, there is always
a matter to compound at the door, before you can get into your chaise; and
that is with the sons and daughters of poverty, who surround you. Let no
man say, 'Let them go to the devil'&mdash;'tis a cruel journey to send a few
miserables, and they have had sufferings enow without it. I always find it
better to take a few sous out in my hand; and I would counsel every gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_172" id="Page_ii_172">[172]</a></span>
traveller to do so likewise: he need not be so exact in setting down his motives
for giving them&mdash;they will be registered elsewhere.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having settled all these small matters, I got into my postchaise with more
ease than ever I got into a postchaise in my life; and La Fleur having got one
large jack-boot on the far side of a little <i>bidet</i> (post-horse), and another on this
(for I count nothing of his legs), he cantered away before me, as happy and as
perpendicular as a prince.</p>

<p>But what is happiness! What is grandeur in this painted scene of life! A
dead ass, before we had got a league, put a stop to La Fleur's career&mdash;his <i>bidet</i>
would not pass it; a contention arose betwixt them, and the poor fellow was
kicked out of his jack-boots the very first kick.</p>

<p>La Fleur bore his fall like a French Christian, saying neither more or less
upon it than <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Diable!</i> so presently got up and came to the charge again&mdash;then
this way&mdash;then that way: and, in short, every way but by the dead ass. La
Fleur insisted upon the thing&mdash;and the <em>bidet</em> threw him.</p>

<p>'What's the matter, La Fleur,' said I, 'with this <em>bidet</em> of thine?' '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</i>,'
said he, '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c'est un cheval le plus opiniatre du monde</i>.' 'Nay, if he is a conceited
beast, he must go his own way,' replied I. So La Fleur got off him, and giving
him a good sound lash, the <em>bidet</em> took me at my word, and away he scampered
back to Montriul. '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Peste!</i>' said La Fleur.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Diable!</i> which is the first and positive degree, is generally used for
ordinary emotions of the mind, where small things only fall out contrary to your
expectation, such as&mdash;the throwing one's doublets&mdash;La Fleur's being kicked off
his horse, and so forth&mdash;cuckoldom, for the same reason, is always&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Diable!</i></p>

<p>But in cases where the cast has something provoking in it, as in that of the
<em>bidet's</em> running away after&mdash;and leaving La Fleur aground in jack-boots&mdash;'tis the
second degree. 'Tis then <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Peste!</i></p>

<p>As there was no hunting down a frightened horse in jack-boots, there remained
no alternative but taking La Fleur either behind the chaise or into it.</p>

<p>I preferred the latter, and in half an hour we got to the post-house at Namport.</p>

<p class="center small p2">NAMPORT.</p>

<p><cite>The Dead Ass.</cite>&mdash;'And this,' said he, putting the remains of a crust into his
wallet, 'and this should have been thy portion,' said he, 'had'st thou been alive
to have shared it with me.' I thought by the accent it had been an apostrophe
to his child; but it was to his ass, and to the very ass we had seen dead in the
road, which had occasioned La Fleur's misadventure. The man seemed to lament
it much; and it instantly brought into my mind Sancho's lamentation for his;
but he did it with more true touches of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_173" id="Page_ii_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>The mourner was sitting upon a stone bench at the door, with the ass's
pannel and its bridle on one side, which he took up from time to time&mdash;then laid
them down&mdash;looked at them, and shook his head. He then took his crust of
bread out of his wallet again, as if to eat it; held it some time in his hand, then
laid it upon the bit of his ass's bridle&mdash;looked wistfully at the little arrangement
he had made, and then gave a sigh.</p>

<p>The simplicity of his grief drew numbers about him, and La Fleur among
the rest, whilst the horses were getting ready; as I continued sitting in the postchaise,
I could see and hear over their heads.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="LA_FLEUR"></a><img src="images/i_186.jpg" width="600" height="353" alt="" />
<div class="caption">LA FLEUR AND THE DEAD ASS.</div>
</div>

<p>He said he had come last from Spain, where he had been from the farthest
borders of Franconia, and had got so far on his return home, when his ass died.
Everyone seemed desirous to know what business could have taken so old and
poor a man so far a journey from his own home.</p>

<p>It had pleased heaven, he said, to bless him with three sons, the finest lads
in Germany; but having, in one week, lost two of them by the smallpox, and
the youngest falling ill of the distemper, he was afraid of being bereft of them
all; and made a vow, if heaven would not take him from him also, he would go,
in gratitude, to St. Jago, in Spain.</p>

<p>When the mourner got thus far in his story he stopped to pay Nature her
tribute, and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>He said heaven had accepted the conditions, and that he had set out from
his cottage with this poor creature, who had been a patient partner of his journey&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_174" id="Page_ii_174">[174]</a></span>
it had eat the same bread with him all the way and was unto him as a
friend. Everybody who stood about heard the poor fellow with concern. La
Fleur offered him money. The mourner said he did not want it&mdash;it was not the
value of the ass, but the loss of him. The ass, he said, he was assured loved
him&mdash;and upon this told them a long story of mischance upon their passage over
the Pyrenean mountains, which had separated them from each other three days:
during which time the ass had sought him as much as he had sought the ass, and
that they had neither scarce eat or drank till they met.</p>

<p>'Thou hast one comfort, friend,' said I, 'at least in the loss of thy poor beast:
I am sure thou hast been a merciful master to him.' 'Alas!' said the mourner,
'I thought so when he was alive, but now he is dead I think otherwise. I fear
the weight of myself and my afflictions together have been too much for him&mdash;they
have shortened the poor creature's days, and I fear I have them to answer
for.' 'Shame on the world!' said I to myself, 'did we love each other as this
poor soul but loved his ass, 'twould be something.'</p>

eagle, and supported by a second eagle, from Margate over the continents of
Europe, South and North America, the Polar regions, and back to Margate,
within thirty-six hours.</p>

the bridle to the church steeple; the Baron proves himself a good shot, cuts the
bridle in two, and resumes his journey.</p>

many extraordinary feats; the horse is cut in two by the portcullis of
Oczakow, which the Baron only discovers when he leads his spirited steed to
drink at the fountain, and the water flows out at the rear of the severed half.</p>

<p>Bathes in the Mediterranean, is swallowed by a fish, from which he is extricated
by dancing a hornpipe.</p>

<p>The Baron jumps into the sea with a Turkish piece of ordnance on his
shoulders (which fires a marble ball of three hundred pounds weight) and swims
across the Simois.</p>

<p>The ship, driven by a whirlwind, a thousand leagues above the surface of the
waters; the Baron discovers the inhabitants of the moon, with some traders from
the Dog Star.</p>

<p>Travelling in the South Sea they lose their compass; their ship slips between
the teeth of a fish unknown in this part of the world.</p>

<p>The Baron crosses the Thames without the assistance of a bridge, ship, boat,
balloon, or even his own will; being blown out of one of the Tower guns in which
he had fallen asleep, and the cannon is unexpectedly fired to celebrate an anniversary.</p>

<p>Introduction to <cite>The Schoolmasters Tour</cite>. Vol. 1.&mdash;'In the Tour, with the
first part of which we here present our readers, the author carries his hero
through a great variety of whimsical adventures, to the Lakes and back again.
As tours are a fashionable article in the literature of the present day, we trust that
the poetical peregrinations of Doctor Syntax will come in for some share, at least,
of the public applause, to which we conceive it to be entitled. The lovers of
humour will not be displeased to be informed that it will be accompanied with
a considerable number of illustrative engravings.'</p>

<p><i>March 30, 1810.</i> <cite>The Winding up of the Medical Report of the Walcheren
Expedition.</cite>&mdash;The members of the Medical Board are standing in the stocks; on
the green, in front of the sign of <em>The Goose</em>, which is surrounded with stores for
the Walcheren Expedition, are laid the bodies of various sufferers, 'sent home
for inspection.' The nature of the stores is somewhat exceptional. A case of
champagne, marked 'Chelsea Hospital,' innumerable barrels of port and claret,
marked 'T.K., for the hospital and for home consumption.' Barrels of porter,
bales of cobwebs, and oak bark, 'charms for the cure of agues,' tincture of
arsenic, and bottles of gin.</p>

<p><i>April 12, 1810.</i> <cite>Libel Hunters on the Look-out, or Daily Examiners of the
Liberty of the Press.</cite> Published by T. Tegg (4).&mdash;A committee of the <em>Rotten
Borough Society, established in 1810</em> (Gibery Vixe, president; Leatherbreech, vice),
is met to consider the licence of the press, to bring all their faculties to bear for
the detection of any lurking evidences of libel or treason. The President is
reading aloud, with the assistance of a magnifying glass to enlarge any suspicious
paragraphs; the members of the committee are all on the <em>qui vive</em> to note any
libellous allusions. Cobbett's <cite>Register</cite> is under examination, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magna Charta</i> is
trodden under foot, and the <em>Bill of Rights</em> is thrown on one side. From the
papers pasted as memoranda on the wall we are informed that 'Sir Francis
Burdett is committed to the Tower;' that '<em>The Morning Chronicle</em> knows no
bounds and must be checked;' that 'Enquiries into the expedition to Walcheren
be voted treasonable;' 'That the <em>Statesman</em> must beware,' and 'A watchful eye
be kept on the <em>Examiner</em>;' A 'Black list of those who vote in the minority,'
&amp;c.; 'A view of the Tower,' and 'Instructions to the Keeper of Newgate,' are
among the notices put up for attention.</p>

his prowess by the slaughter of a brace of the 'Caterpillars of the State;'
like the infant Hercules, he is taking the dealers in corruption by the neck and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_183" id="Page_ii_183">[183]</a></span>
throttling them. One of the beefeaters is enjoying the spectacle, crying, 'Bless
him, I say; he's a rum un.' Over the portcullis of the Tower gate is an escutcheon
representing the 'British Lion roused.' On one side of the postern is an apposite

<p>An extract from the Liberal Baronet's own speech is posted on the other <span class="locked">side:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>From this foul and traitorous traffic our Boroughmonger Sovereigns derive an immense
revenue, cruelly wrung from the hard hand of honest labour. I do, however, now
entertain an ardent hope that this degraded and degrading system, to which all our
difficulties, grievances, and dangers are owing, will at length give way to the moderate but
determined perseverance of a whole united people.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir Francis Burdett.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>One of the boroughmongering crew is already demolished; by his side, on the
ground, are two money-bags, 'Rapine,' and 'Drainings from the hard hand of
the industrious poor.' Of the twin wretches who are being strangled without
mercy at the hands of Sir Francis Burdett one has in his pocket 'Barrow
(borough?), in Cornwall, bought and sold; apply to&mdash;&mdash;;' two money-bags,
'Extortion money,' and 'Bribery and Corruption bag,' are dropping from his
hands; while in the pocket of the other nefarious agent may be seen 'Rotten
borough to be disposed of.'</p>

<p>'Rowlandson's views in Oxford and Cambridge, 1810, deserve notice for the
slight and pleasing manner with which he has characterised the architecture of
the places mentioned; but it is impossible to surpass the originality of his
figures. The dance of students and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">filles de joie</i> before Christ Church College
is highly humorous, and the enraged tutors grin with anger peculiar to this
artist's pencil. The professors in the view of the Observatory at Oxford are
made as ugly as baboons, and yet the profundity of knowledge they possess is
conspicuous at the first glance, and we should know them to be Masters of Arts
without the aid of a background. The scene in Emmanuel College garden,
Cambridge, exhibits the learned in a state of relaxation; several handsome
lasses remove apples from a tree, and the indolent curiosity with which they are
viewed by these sons of ease is very characteristic.'&mdash;<em>Malcolm's 'History of
Caricature.'</em></p>

passion, wreaking her vengeance on all around; Talleyrand is levelled with the
floor by a blow from the sceptre; he is crying, 'Be Gar, she will give us all de
finishing stroke.' A marshal is seeking refuge behind the curtains and declaring:
'Marbleu, vat a crown-cracker she be!' The little Emperor is dodging behind
an armchair, beseeching his stricken prime minister, 'Tally, Tally,' to 'rise and
rally.' The Empress is threatening to hurl the Imperial crown at her intimidated
lord and master, protesting, 'By the Head of Jove, I hate him worse than famine
or disease. Perish his family! let inveterate hate commence between our houses
from this moment, and meeting, never let them bloodless part.' The coronation
throne has the crown knocked off; and, kicked on the floor by this untamable
Austrian, are all the conquered diadems of Europe, including the Pope's tiara
and the iron crown of Italy.</p>

<p><i>May 15. 1810.</i> <cite>A Bonnet Shop.</cite> Rowlandson del. Tegg's collection (17).&mdash;This
plate is best described from the advertisement of the proprietress, displayed
on her premises, for the manufacture of the straw bonnets and hats which
were the <em>mode</em> at the beginning of the century: 'Miss Flimsey's fashionable
warehouse; the greatest variety of straw hats and bonnets made up in the most
elegant taste. A large stock of Spanish, Flemish, Provincial, Gipsy, Cottage,
Woodland, &amp;c., &amp;c., adapted to show every feature to advantage.'</p>

<p>An old fright is trying on an unbecoming straw-bonnet at a mirror, while a
handsome saleswoman is puffing her wares. A number of pretty apprentices are
trimming hats, and an antiquated quiz, with his spyglass, is poking his head
through the window, and saluting the bevy of beauties with a satyr-like grin.</p>

<p>'<cite>Miseries &agrave; la Mode.</cite>&mdash;The being over-persuaded by a canting shopwoman, in
endeavouring to puff off a stale article, that it is the most becoming and suitable
to your style of features; but on consulting your friends and acquaintance they
pronounce it the most frightful, hideous, and unfashionably formed thing&mdash;that
would disgrace Cranbourne Alley.'</p>

<p><i>May 20, 1810.</i> <cite>Peter Plumb's Diary.</cite> Published by T. Tegg (18).&mdash;The
picture represents the drawing-room of a 'warm citizen,' evidently 'worth a plum.'
The corpulent master of the house and the no less well-favoured partner of his
bosom are seated before a capital fire; the comfortable couple have drunk their
port and supped their punch, of which a capacious bowl is ready to hand on a
table between them; the host has smoked a whiff of 'Turkey' and then dropped
off to sleep in his armchair; his wife has followed his example; and a fat
poodle, snugly laid on a soft cushion before the fender, is dozing luxuriously; the
motto of the house is written over the mantel: 'Eating, drinking, and sleeping,
with the generality of people, form the three important articles of life.' The
blooming daughter, a melting young damsel, has her own creed on the subject.
An opportunity is offered for a little flirtation; a gallant and good-looking young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_188" id="Page_ii_188">[188]</a></span>
buck is saluting her with a tender embrace; the pair have sat down to perform
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">duetto prestissimo</i>, but the swain's flute is discarded, and the fair pianist is
negligently touching the keyboard to a lively air, <em>Lucy's Delight</em>, while the
flirtation is proceeding undisturbed by the presence of the slumbering parents.</p>

<p>Peter Plumb is a desirable father-in-law, and his commercial interests are set
forth in 'a view of Wapping Docks,' and a plan, suspended on rollers, for the
'new improvement of the Cattle Market in Smithfield.'</p>

<p>The existence of the sleeper would appear an easy one; witness the extract
from <cite>Peter Plumb's Diary</cite>. This honest man being of greater consequence in
his own thoughts than 'in the eye of the world,' had for some years past kept a
journal of his life. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Videlicet</i>, the following exciting <span class="locked">example:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>May 30, 1810.</i> <cite>A Table d'H&ocirc;te, or French Ordinary in Paris.</cite> (20).&mdash;The
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Table d'H&ocirc;te</i> is an appropriate companion to the <cite>Paris Diligence</cite>. The travellers
have duly reached the capital, and a scene of Parisian life is shown on their
arrival in the French metropolis. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle &agrave; manger</i>, where the ordinary is held,
is a handsome apartment, decorated in showy taste with enrichments in plaster,
canopies, curtains, mirrors, &amp;c. The repast is in active course, and its humours
are improved on with an observant eye. The company is diversified; there are
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeois</i> and their wives, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits-ma&icirc;tres</i>, marquises, fat friars, and ladies of various
degrees, all complaisance and graciousness. A Savoyard, with a hurdy-gurdy,
and her daughter, with a triangle, are 'discoursing sweet sounds' to enliven the
repast. A dog is taught to beg for food. The manners of the feeders are of
different shades. Pledging toasts, flirtations, and small gallantries animate the
severer business of the hour. Several whimsical accidents are introduced, results
of awkward or inattentive service on the part of waiters; one grave citizen is
receiving a scalding <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouillon</i> in his eye, while a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouilli</i> is simultaneously poured
over a bowing dandy; a glass of wine is capsized into a lady's plate while her
attention is diverted; and a piggish priest, whose soup is suffered to stream
down the corners of his fat jowl, has his shaven pate saluted by a cascade from a
bottle tilted up by a heedless fair <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">domestique</i>, whose regards are engaged by the
pleasantries of an amorous old fogey by her side, with whom she is exchanging
jocularities.</p>

<p>1810 (?). <cite>Paris Diligence.</cite> Rowlandson del. et sculp. Published by T.
Tegg.&mdash;This print is one of a class somewhat superior to the average series
published in Cheapside. The scene is a favourite one with the artist, and his
early experiences in France here serve him in valuable stead. It is in pictures of
Continental life, before the aspects of the quaint and picturesque surroundings
were entirely transmogrified by the French Revolution, that we recognise Rowlandson
at his best. The value of these sketches is perhaps greater than of any
other works his facile hand has bequeathed us, and the interest of these subjects
is found to appeal to a larger circle of admirers.</p>

<p>The <em>diligence</em> is starting from a massively built and handsome innyard, the
sign of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coq en P&acirc;te</i>. The 'machine' is a cumbersome vehicle, clumsy and
heavy to an incredible degree. It is drawn&mdash;at no rapid pace, it is certain&mdash;by
four strong, long, ill-favoured steeds, harnessed with ropes to the Noah's Ark-like
contrivance, and ridden by two postilions, who are cracking their long
thonged whips without producing much acceleration of speed in the toiling team.
The timber of the diligence would be heavy for a gun-carriage, and the construction
of the entire concern is perfectly primitive. A huge basket in front, about
the size of a porter's lodge, is presumably the 'luggage boot;' below this are two
small and heavy wheels, while at the other end of the machine are two enormous
hind-wheels. The elongated body of the vehicle seems also to be made of rough
basket-work. Through the unglazed spaces for windows are seen the occupants,
who are travelling Pariswards: an assortment of corpulent and shaven monks,
peasant women, and an old veteran with a formidable pigtail; a fashionable lady
in feathers is ogling a beau wearing a powdered wig and enormous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">solitaire</i>.
The roof itself is also loaded; another fat friar, with shaven poll, is reading his
book, over which is peeping a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;bonnaire</i> damsel of redundant charms, who is
flirting a gigantic fan; an officer, with an enormous cocked-hat and a massive
club, has his hands in a muff of pantomimic magnitude; by his side is a lively
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grisette</i>, with a parasol; another officer is reclining behind.</p>

<p>The <em>diligence</em> is attended by the usual mendicants, vociferously appealing for
alms. The background is a quaint French town of some importance; a jack-booted
rider is clattering along in the rear of a travelling-carriage, which is posting
to the capital, driven by a postilion. Down the street is shown a procession of
well-fed friars; and a party of devout nuns are striking attitudes at the foot of a
carved figure. The whole picture recalls the precise aspect France wore at the
time Sterne made his famous 'Sentimental Journey,' and the scene might well be
a chapter from that picturesque pilgrimage.</p>

Sam and Medley, fought May 31, 1810, on Moulsey Hurst, near Hampton.</cite> Published
by T. Tegg. Tegg's caricatures (22).&mdash;The artist has drawn the fight,
judging from the appearance offered by the opponents, during the first round,
while all was cool and scientific. The champions, stripped to the waist, are
sparring round one another on guard; their seconds are eagerly following up the
principals; the two bottle-holders are seated on the grass. The spectators, a
very orderly company, according to the picture, are arranged on the grass in a
wide circle, while beyond the amateurs on foot is a ring of vehicles, on the roofs
of which are perched the more fashionable portion of the patrons of the Ring,
amongst whom are seen some of the softer sex.</p>

<p>'The concourse of people exceeded anything we have ever witnessed. The
spectators were computed at ten thousand. At one o'clock the champions entered
the ring, and Sam had for his second Harry Lee, whilst Joe Ward officiated
for Medley. After a severe and bloody contest of forty-nine rounds victory was
decided in favour of Sam.'</p>

<p><i>August 8, 1810.</i> <cite>Smuggling Out, or Starting from Gretna Green.</cite> Rowlandson
del. Schultz scul. Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;A gallant
officer is assisting a pretty and precocious boarding-school miss to elope from a
balcony window; a post-chaise is waiting in readiness to carry the fugitives
'across the Border,' and a servant in attendance has secured the damsel's personal
belongings in a portmanteau on his shoulders.</p>

<p><i>August 8, 1810.</i> <cite>Smuggling In, or a College Trick.</cite>&mdash;The picture represents
the corner of a college quadrangle. Three festive and mischievously disposed
collegians appear at the window of their rooms; with the contrivance of a sling
and a stout rope they are managing to draw up, clandestinely, as they fondly
imagine, a pretty, modish, and, we fear, wanton maiden, who is not in the least
terrified or abashed at her situation, but is entering into the spirit of the adventure.
A frowning proctor, who is scandalised at these reprehensible irregularities,
is standing in an angle, half-concealed in the shadow, scowling at the
party, and waiting to dart out and surprise the violators of the academical proprieties
at the critical moment for their detection.</p>

<p><i>September 8, 1810.</i> <cite>Procession of the Cod Company from St. Giles's to
Billingsgate.</cite> Published by T. Tegg (11).&mdash;A view of old Billingsgate, overlooking
the river, with the fish being landed from the crowds of smacks at the
old covered jetty, since swept away. The pilgrimage of the sturdy members of
<em>The Cod Company</em>, we presume, is made to the craft on the river to take in cargoes
of fish. The procession is composed of corpulent old Irish women, of colossal
breadth and strength, all balancing their fish-baskets on their heads, some
smoking their cherished clay pipes, and carrying their stoutly developed arms
crossed, akimbo, or on their hips, after their individual proclivities.</p>

<p><i>September 25, 1810.</i> <cite>Rigging out a Smuggler.</cite> Published by T. Tegg
(8).&mdash;A party of sailors in a cabin are fitting out a handsome young creature
to 'run the gauntlet' of the Custom-house officers, or rather to go on shore,
with as full a cargo of excisable articles as they can secure round her
person. Huge pockets of 'old Japan china, tea, gum,' &amp;c. are disposed round
her waist, together with a small keg of 'coniac,' and a flagon of otto of roses.
Chests of Congou and Souchon and flasks of arrack are standings about.</p>

<p><i>September 30, 1810.</i> <cite>Dramatic Demireps at their Morning Rehearsal.</cite>
Published by T. Tegg (10).&mdash;The intention of this burlesque is a pun on
<em>dram-atic</em>; the theatrical demireps being very ungallantly displayed in the
Hundreds of Drury, inhabiting an attic, and indulging in matutinal potations
of gin. The surroundings do not give a very cultivated idea of the actresses
or their belongings. <em>The Chapter of Accidents</em> seems to be the piece in rehearsal.
The toilettes of the fair performers are shockingly neglected. Over the mantelpiece
are various professional announcements 'for the benefit of the Theatrical
Fund,' &amp;c. By the side of an '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&Agrave; la mode</i> beef jug' is a melon marked 'Ripe&mdash;rotten,'
and other ironical allusions to current scandals and personages then well
recognised are posted on the walls, as sketches for portraits: <em>Peg and the Duke</em>,
<em>Bald as a Coote</em>, <em>Little Darby O! Ever Craving</em>, and <em>Old Q.</em>, and various
innuendoes hardly flattering to the originals indicated.</p>

<p><i>October 5, 1810.</i> <cite>Sports of a Country Fair.</cite> Part the First. Published by
T. Tegg.&mdash;The bustling picture of a country fair in full operation. In the rear
are swings, booths, and theatrical shows. In the foreground is shown a cart
overset; a man is holding on to the head of the horse, which in rearing has
snapped his girths and tilted the cart on end, while the late occupants are
thrown down in motley confusion, sprawling on the turf, pommelling, kicking,
shrieking, and throwing up their limbs, while eager groups of spectators are
hurrying up to enjoy the disaster.</p>

<p><i>October 5, 1810.</i> <cite>Sports of a Country Fair.</cite> Part the Second.&mdash;A nearer
view of the same fair: the thick of the crowd; stick-throwing for snuffboxes,
oyster-opening, pocket-picking, and a round-about swing; one of the boats is
giving way, and a fair swinger and her swain are falling through. There is an
inn where cordials are supplied, through the windows of which various scenes of
love-making are visible. In the distance may be seen Polito's stage-booths,
horse-racing, and other diversions.</p>

<p><i>October, 1810.</i> <cite>Sports of a Country Fair.</cite> Part the Third. Published by
T. Tegg.&mdash;The interior of another booth-theatre; the play is interrupted; the
only performer on the stage is thrown into consternation, and the whole of the
audience are dispersing in terror at an unexpected intruder. A royal Bengal
tiger has made his escape from an adjoining show, and is bounding through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_192" id="Page_ii_192">[192]</a></span>
canvas walls of the theatrical booth, threatening to descend plump into the
auditorium. The effect on the frightened playgoers may be well imagined.
Some are prostrate with terror; one man is down on his knees and cannot move
for fright; ladies are fainting; husbands are manfully endeavouring to carry off
their wives out of the way of the terrible visitor, and everything is turned topsy-turvy.</p>

<p>1810. <cite>Sports of a Country Fair.</cite>&mdash;The sport in this case is accidental, and
the amusement verges on peril of a terrible character. A temporary theatre,
<em>Cockburn's Company</em>, is on fire, and the spectators are escaping as best they may.
The entrance is from a balcony reached by a flight of steps, and the frightened
spectators are pouring out of the building, which is burning furiously, and throwing
themselves pellmell down the steps, at the bottom of which they are sprawling,
kicking, and plunging in fright and confusion. Certain buxom damsels are
climbing over the balustrade and dropping from the balcony, with the musicians,
into the arms of those below. A bill on the booth announces the <em>Last Night,
Pizarro</em> and <em>Don Juan, A Shower of Real Fire</em>, and <em>A View of the Infernal
Regions</em>. Crowds are scudding away in the distance, and the other attractions
of the fair are at a standstill.</p>

A deceptive old tabby, clad in a juvenile style, is dashing along in a high
poke-bonnet; three or four Don Juans of eccentric exterior are hurrying after
her to tender their attentions, an act of gallantry they are likely to regret on
closer inspection. The quotation offered as <cite>A Misery of Human Life</cite> runs
thus: 'Walking fast and far to overtake a woman from whose shape and air as
viewed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en derri&egrave;re</i> you have decided that her face is angelic, till, on eagerly
turning round as you pass her, you are petrified by a Gorgon.'</p>

straight and bony proportions, who it appears is in the last stage of wasting

resting on the chimneypiece, and a glass of 'cherry bounce' held in her chubby
hand, to refresh her after the exertions of the day. A younger and proportionately
comely and comfortable-looking kitchen-maid is also stealing 'forty winks,'
with her head resting against the chimneypiece; while a fat black footman, who
completes this evidently easy-going household, is indulging in the luxury of
repose and pillowing his slumbering woolly pate on the ample shoulders of his
shapely neighbour.</p>

more certain by opium and composing draughts placed ready to her hand. On
the armchair of the ghastly sufferer leans a pretty buxom girl in the flush of
womanhood, who is wavering between grief and rapture&mdash;tears for her departing
relative and regard for the caresses of the practitioner, who is dismissing his
patient and courting a bride at the same moment. While one hand of the
perfidious Doctor is carelessly holding the pulse of the sinking woman his arm
is thrown round the neck of the blooming maiden, his fat features are expressive
of maudlin tenderness, and his eyes are turned upwards in awkward
admiration.</p>

and tumbling down hill and blowing in the wind; the gouty hangers behind
being urged forward, pushed, whipped, and cheered on by the delighted spectators.
The city of Bath is slightly indicated in the rear.</p>

Corporal has incautiously been paying a secret visit to a fine, plump and well-favoured
damsel, on whose affections, it would seem, the man of war has no
legitimate claim. The lady is snugly disposing her lover in a strong-box, with
iron clamps, probably the sea-chest of the lawful proprietor of the chamber.
Before closing the lid on the captive swain the buxom maid, at whose waist
hangs the key of the chest, is favouring the suitor with a parting kiss. An old
'salt,' his few remaining hairs bristling with indignation and resentment, is
looking in at the window and surveying the entire transaction before making his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_195" id="Page_ii_195">[195]</a></span>
entrance on the scene. That the Corporal has fairly got into the 'wrong box' is
further hinted by a trap at his side, in which an unfortunate rat is securely imprisoned.</p>

<p>1810. <cite>The Harmonic Society. 'The Assemblies of women are too frequently

noise, inebriety, and wrangling.'</cite>&mdash;A companion scene to <cite>The Breaking up of a
Blue Stocking Club</cite> (March 1, 1815). The direst disorder, according to the plate,
is proceeding around on all sides: the conflict of fists, aided by such aggressive
articles as bottles, the fireirons, and any offensive weapon that may come to
hand, is raging free and furious. The president of this <em>harmonic meeting</em> is
very naturally employing his hammer to bring the turbulent to order, by using
it as an instrument to knock down his opponents. Wigs are sent flying 'through
space,' chairs are wrecked; decanters, spirit-bottles, punchbowls, and such frail
objects as tumblers, rummers, and wine-glasses, are involved in universal destruction.
One elated youthful hero has jumped on the table in a tipsy frolic; he
is promoting the further confusion which darkness will entail by deliberately
smashing up the candles, and battering the sconces of the chandelier with the
assistance of a punch-ladle.</p>

this famous view of the relative estates of the realm stand under niches; the
head of the State is the first represented; and next, of course, is the Church;
then the powers militant; and lastly, as a sort of necessary evil, the commonalty&mdash;perhaps
better kept out of sight altogether, since the presence of the representative
of this portion of the empire is not acknowledged by the other three, his pastors
and masters. Number one, George the Third; the King in this case is represented
strutting in awful but somewhat awkward majesty. To quote a national

military officer drawn by Rowlandson rather reminds one of Colonel Wardle,
whose person the caricaturist had made a little too familiar&mdash;'I fight for all;' and
lastly comes John Bull, under his agricultural aspect, a simple farmer, with his
smock, hay-fork, and dog, and, what is more to the purpose, his bag of 'hard

<p>1810 (?). <cite>The Rabbit Merchant.</cite> Published by T. Tegg (25).&mdash;The view
of a country street; a rabbit seller, with a selection of his stock on his pole, is
offering a choice to an old dame, who is somewhat hypercritical, and is employing
a test which the rabbit merchant considers excessive and uncalled for; he is represented
as offering 'the retort courteous' in justification of his goods.</p>

<p>1810 (?). <cite>A Sale of English Beauties in the East Indies.</cite>&mdash;Although, as we
have noticed, Rowlandson's work was stamped by the strongest originality, he,
like other etchers of caricatures, often executed the ideas or worked out the first
impressions of less experienced draughtsmen; however, unlike most engravers,
he has left, in his numerous plates after Wigstead, Woodward, Bunbury, Nixon,
Newton, &amp;c. (in all cases the name of the originator is given), but slight traces of
the defects and shortcomings of the amateur artists whose sketches he has put into
circulation, the major part of the engravings bearing unmistakable and easily
recognised evidence of Rowlandson's individuality. In the case of the present
caricature he has, in some degree, departed from this practice, probably at the
desire of the publisher of the print, and has gone to Gillray's large and spirited
plate entitled <em>A Sale of English Beauties in the East Indies</em> for the materials of
his version of the same subject. It is noticeable, however, that while he has, in
a free-handed manner, preserved the chief points and indeed most of the figures
of the original (published March 16, 1786), he has forborne to put his own name
to the copy. It is probable that the original version was, at the date of the
smaller copy, in demand and difficult to purchase, and, to satisfy the requirements
of both publishers and public, Rowlandson has etched this second edition of his
friend's plate, Gillray having unhappily lost his reason at the date of the republication.</p>

<p>The scene is supposed to be drawn from one of the landing-places in the
East Indies. A merchantman has arrived with a cargo which has proved a source
of excitement and attraction to residents of all classes. The fair sex being in
great apparent request, a shipload of English beauties on arriving in the East
would naturally produce commotion and competition among natives and foreigners
alike. A dapper auctioneer is mounted on a bale of books lately arrived, a similar
package forms his desk, and he is knocking down a very attractive article, which
seems likely to bring a handsome figure. A fine tall beauty is under the scrutiny
of a rich Nabob; a young officer is trying to win her ear, and an envoy from the
Government, with instructions in his pocket from the Governor-General, is calculating
the lady's height with his walking-stick held as a measure. Similar incidents
are represented around; the Rajahs are inspecting the latest importations with
true merchant-like caution; sundry bargains have already been secured, and
in the scales is shown a method of approximating valuations; a well-favoured
arrival of the florid and fully developed type is set against a corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_198" id="Page_ii_198">[198]</a></span>
weight of 'lacs of rupees.' In the background is pictured a large warehouse
for 'unsaleable goods from Europe&mdash;to be returned by the next ship'&mdash;and
several damsels are in great distress at being forced to take refuge within this
unpopular establishment.</p>

<p><i>January 18, 1811.</i> <cite>College Pranks, or Crabbed Fellows Taught to Caper on
the Slack Rope.</cite> Published by T. Tegg (53).&mdash;Two portly, and highly respectable
Fellows of the University, proceeding along their quadrangle, are assailed with
a rough practical joke by a party of unruly young undergraduates; a rope is
being suddenly lifted up with a hearty good-will by a riotous mob at either end,
and the astonished 'dons' are tripped up and turned over like turtles on a
memorial-stone&mdash;'Here lies the body of <em>Bishop Bleareyes</em>.' Squibs, squirts, and
whips, in the hands of these disorderly students, are further contributing to the
annoyance of the capsized magnates.</p>

<p><i>February, 1811.</i> <cite>A Sleepy Congregation.</cite> Rowlandson fecit. Published by
T. Tegg (54).&mdash;The interior of a parish church. Of the occupants of a family-pew
in the foreground the elders are sleeping, while a fair young worshipper's
thoughts are evidently wandering; the attentions of one or two buckish youths,
seated in the vicinity, seem to be centred on the lady; the clerk is snoring at his
desk, regardless of the podgy and somewhat excited preacher over his head, who
is quite absorbed in his sermon, which does not seem to interest anyone but
the deliverer.</p>

<p><i>February 12, 1811.</i> <cite>A Midwife going to a Labour.</cite> Tegg's Caricatures (55).&mdash;The
stout old nurse, a body of balloon-like expansiveness, is hurrying off,
summoned to her duties, at an unearthly hour of the morning. Her head-gear is
flowing about in the wind, her hood and cape are caught by the gale; a lantern
is held in one hand, a brandy-bottle and a bundle, containing her luggage, are
cuddled up in the other, and she is mounted on pattens. The night-watchman
is dozing in his box, and a shivering chimney-sweeping lad is crouching along to
his early toil, with brushes and bags.</p>

<p><i>February 16, 1811.</i> <cite>The Gig-Shop, or Kicking up a Breeze at Nell Hamilton's
Hop.</cite> Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;According to the picture of this place of 'fast'
resort, dancing has given way to much rougher diversions, and, although the
musicians are in their gallery, playing away as if the scene below was the regular
thing, the place appropriated for the dance is given up to a <em>mill</em> conducted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_200" id="Page_ii_200">[200]</a></span>
strikingly professional principles; one of the combatants has 'peeled' in recognised
style, and his opponent has stripped to his shirt; the backers and seconders of
the fisticuffing bucks (who are freely besprinkled with the ruby fluid) are members
of the fair sex; in fact, ladies seem in the ascendant at this entertainment. A
ring of delighted spectators are enjoying the fight and the fun from the benches,
while other gentlemen are prudently engaged in restraining their fair partners
from getting mixed up in the squabble which is raging fast and furious, thick
and general, behind the two 'milling' gentlemen; ladies using their fists manfully,
kicking, tearing hair, and throwing themselves into desperate warfare with
terrific confusion and effect. In the foreground a fair nymph of interesting but
dishevelled appearance, probably the <em>friend</em> of one of the combatants, is falling
into a fainting fit, from which the attentions of those who surround her seem
inadequate to restore her to consciousness.</p>

<p><i>February 20, 1811.</i> <cite><a href="#PIGEON_HOLE">Pigeon Hole</a>, a Covent Garden Contrivance to Coop the
Gods.</cite> Published by T. Tegg (57).&mdash;The miseries consequent on heat and
crowding in a restricted space, as displayed in the Pigeon Hole Galleries of John
Kemble's newly-constructed Drury Lane Theatre, gave rise to the present
caricature, which is further explained under the head of <em>This is the House that Jack
Built</em> (Sept. 27, 1809), and <em>The Boxes</em> (Dec. 12, 1809). General dissatisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_201" id="Page_ii_201">[201]</a></span>
was expressed by all but the privileged subscribers; the lessee's treatment of
the humble supporters of the drama, the frequenters of the gallery, gave special
offence; and the illiberality of the management which provided such disgraceful
accommodation for its patrons was resented by the unruly proceedings known
as the <em>O. P. Riots</em>, which marked the public sense of the transaction.</p>

<p><i>February 26, 1811.</i> <cite>A French Dentist Showing a Specimen of his Artificial
Teeth and False Palates.</cite> Published by T. Tegg (58).&mdash;It is not easy to determine
whether this caricature was intended solely as a satire or as an advertisement
for some dental professor who was established here at the time. In
Rowlandson's day, however, false teeth were sufficient novelties to be welcome
subjects for ridicule. An overgrown and exuberantly corpulent female is serving
as a sample of the Frenchman's skill; her widely distended mouth is liberally
displaying a wonderful set of masticators. The professor is the typical foreigner
of the period, wearing hair-powder, a bag-wig, and earrings. An old beau,
looking through a quizzing-glass, is admiring the prospect of securing a decent
set of teeth, his own gums exhibiting a very ragged and defective regiment. An
advertisement in the rear sets forth: '<em>Mineral Teeth.</em>&mdash;Monsieur De Charmant,
from Paris, engages to affix from one tooth to a whole set, without pain. Monsieur
D. can also affix an artificial palate or a glass eye in a manner peculiar to himself;
he also distils, &amp;c., &amp;c.'</p>

<p><i>March, 1811.</i> <cite>Bacon-faced Fellows of Brazen-Nose Broke Loose.</cite> Published
by T. Tegg (59).&mdash;The persons of learned members of the Universities were not
treated with a sparing hand by the satirist. Rowlandson has introduced various
incidents of college life into his caricatures; but, throughout the series, the
waggishly-inclined artist does not, we are afraid, exhibit any particular respect
for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alma Mater</i>. The Fellows of Brasenose are drawn, with unusual unction,
issuing from their Hall and through the archways of the Colleges, dressed in
their academic guise, and pouring forth like a sable stream of erudition. The
various expressions and attitudes of the 'big-wigs' are vastly well hit off; their
diversified peculiarities of face or motion are full of comicality. These grave
sons of the Church are not free from gallant considerations&mdash;a buxom wench, with
a basket of fruit slung round her shapely neck, is the centre of attraction; the
'Bacon-faced Fellows' are crowded around, bargaining for her ware and leering
at the seller with undisguised and clumsy admiration. A reflection is cast on the
<em>Vice</em>-Chancellor, who is vainly endeavouring to steal into his apartments without
being detected by the rest of the sly grinning Fellows, with a weighty folio
under his arm, and followed by an engaging young fruiteress, a lump of rustic
innocence, bearing her baskets, for better selection from the contents, to the seclusion
of the Vice's study.</p>

<p><i>March 10, 1811.</i> <cite>She Stoops to Conquer.</cite> Published by T. Tegg (61).&mdash;The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_202" id="Page_ii_202">[202]</a></span>
central room of a prison. Various strong doors and iron-grated windows open on
the chamber. Bolts, padlocks, and strings of fetters indicate the nature of the
security. Behind a grating is seen a prisoner, on whose behalf a buxom damsel is
supposed to 'stoop to conquer,' since by dint of a plentiful repast, renewed strong
potations, and those tender cajoleries which are believed to be the special weapons
of the fair, the lady is evidently endeavouring to gain possession of the precious
keys which will enable her to set her imprisoned swain at liberty.</p>

<p><i>March 12, 1811.</i> <cite>The Anatomist.</cite> Published by T. Tegg (60).&mdash;The
meaning of this print is not very obvious. It may be assumed that Dr. Sawbones
has secured a new subject; but whether an admirer of the anatomist's lady
has had himself conveyed into her presence by simulating death, or changing
places with the 'subject,' does not appear. However, the critical situation of the
lively gentleman on trestles does not seem conducive to a tranquil frame of mind;
the operator is deliberately getting out his saws, knives, scissors, and other
repellent anatomical instruments in a business-like spirit, for he has, according
to an announcement, to deliver <em>A Course of Anatomical Lectures, accompanied
with Dissections</em>, and he is in want of a subject for demonstration. The lady,
filled with the direst apprehensions, is trying to impress on the anatomist the
remarkable and unusual fact that the dead man has returned to life.</p>

<p><i>March 16, 1811.</i> <cite>Sailors on Horseback.</cite> Published by T. Tegg (62).&mdash;This
print is one of the numerous instances of subjects designed by amateurs and
given to Rowlandson to engrave, and, in most respects, to put into shape.
According to the humours of this print four sailors, mounted on horseback, are
going off on an equestrian cruise by the seashore. The British Tar most at his
ease has been lashed with strong cables to the back of his steed beyond a chance
of drifting loose: 'Here I come, my hearties, right and tight&mdash;smart sailing; but
never mind that&mdash;I can't be cast away, for my commander, Heavens bless
him, has lashed me to the deck with some tough old cables!' His neighbour,
who has a restive horse, requests, 'Keep more to the starboard, and be <span class="locked">d&mdash;&mdash;</span>
to you; don't you see how you make my vessel run ahead!' A third, riding
behind, is mounted on an animal who is taking into his head to launch out in the
rear: <span class="locked">'D&mdash;&mdash;</span> me, how she heaves; why, this is worse than a jolly-boat in the
Bay of Biscay!' A comrade, having had a spill, has been left on the road, and is
in danger of being run over: 'Mind what you are at, messmates, for I am upset,
and the frigate I came on board of has been under way without me this half-hour.'</p>

<p><i>March 28, 1811.</i> <cite>Kitty Careless in Quod, or Waiting for Jew Bail.</cite> Published
by T. Tegg (65).&mdash;A dashing young lady of fashion, who has evidently
been running ahead of the constable, is 'laid by the heels' in a spunging-house;
the apartment in which she is lodged belongs, it appears from a printed
notice on the wall, to <em>MacNab, Sheriff's Officer for the County of Middlesex&mdash;genteel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_203" id="Page_ii_203">[203]</a></span>
accommodation for ladies and gentlemen</em>. Heavy locks and bolts to the
door, and massive bars to the window, indicate the security of Kitty's keeping.
The fair captive does not seem depressed by her confinement: seated before a
glowing fire, her legs crossed in easy indifference, the prisoner is drinking
bumpers of port wine with her captors; a spectacle by no means unusual in the
days of this publication, when the extravagances of people of fashion were
constantly leading them to the confinement of a spunging-house.</p>

<p><i>April 1, 1811.</i> <cite>Pastime in Portugal, or a Visit to the Nunneries.</cite> Published
by T. Tegg (64).&mdash;The principal figure in this picture is that of a young officer
belonging to the British army opposed to the French legions on the Peninsula;
in company with a Portuguese don he has come to visit one of the nunneries
which were sufficiently abundant in the country; three well-favoured members of
the sisterhood and a sour-looking old harridan, by way of duenna, have come to
the 'grill,' or large grated window, which was employed to cut off the 'cloistered
ones' from the rest of the world. We are able to gather from the illustrations of
the period that travellers were accustomed to make visits to nunneries, where
they purchased objects manufactured by the inmates, who were regarded by our
countrymen as a kind of show; the visitors, however, were always restricted to the
outside of the grating which separated the sisterhood from more intimate association
with a wicked world. In Rowlandson's sketch the pretty nuns are offering
silk purses, of their own knitting, to their dashing visitor, whose attention is more
exclusively occupied by the very decided personal attractions of the fair recluses.</p>

<p><i>April 5, 1811.</i> <cite>The Last Drop.</cite> Published by T. Rowlandson, 1 James
Street, Adelphi.&mdash;A short and corpulent <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon-vivant</i>, not unlike a balloon in
figure, whose waistband has been abnormally distended by the bibulous propensities
of the owner, is standing on tiptoe tilting up to his eager lips a huge
punchbowl, too well filled to be lifted bodily; he is transferring the contents
to his own inside with much gusto. While the veteran and inordinate toper is
greedily engulfing his last bumping measure he is too busily engaged in the
important work in hand to notice that <em>Death</em>, in his bony personality as a
ghastly skeleton, is helping to raise the finishing bowl, while the fatal dart is
poised over his head, ready for the stroke which will follow this last potation
before the tippler has time to recover his breath. The stout gentleman has evidently
enjoyed a lengthy innings, and, from the instances scattered about him, he
has made the most of his opportunities; he is surrounded by the remnants of
the good and bad things with which he has made away&mdash;barrels of stout, bottles
of port, puncheons of <em>usquebaugh</em>, and spirits of all sorts; in fact, a very cellar of
the strong drinks which in his day have fallen to the share of the departing toper.</p>

uniform, is seated before the fire, making caudle&mdash;of French blood&mdash;for the
infant prince; a row of sovereign-crowns, wrested from the wearers, are
ranged on the mantelpiece. Napoleon's heir, the miniature of his sire, with the
addition of a monkey's tail, is tearing and clawing at his parent, and is held on a
cushion placed outside the Imperial cradle, which is inscribed <em>Devil's Darling</em>.
Napoleon is haranguing in his usual grandiose style: 'Rejoice, ye Frenchmen;
the fruits of my labour has produced a little image of myself. I shall, for the
love I owe your country, instil in my noble offspring the same principles of lying,
thieving, treachery, letchery, murder, and all other foul deeds, for which I am
now worshipped and adored!' The Pope is kneeling by his side, and pronouncing
by way of a benediction over the infant:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>April 10, 1811.</i> <cite>A Picture of Misery.</cite> Published by T. Tegg (70).&mdash;The
bare and chilling chamber is occupied by a leaden-hued and sordid-looking
miser, opposite to whom is seated an individual of starved aspect; a pinched
and shrivelled old beldame is seen at the door. A table of interest is the only
literature the room can boast. The miser is crouching before the grate, and
snuffing out the single candle for economy. Above the usurer hangs his own
portrait; he is painted congenially occupied in weighing guineas; a list of
securities, 'Stock Ex., Bank Stock, 3 per Cents., Imperial, Omnium, South
Sea, Exchequer, Lottery,' &amp;c., recalls sweet reflections. Below are the lines:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>April 12, 1811.</i> <cite>Puss in Boots, or General Junot taken by Surprise.</cite> Rowlandson
del. Published by T. Tegg (71).&mdash;A dashing young damsel has secured
the jack-boots, cocked-hat, and long sword of General Junot, and is assuming
valiant airs, dressed in these borrowed plumes, and threatening the French
commander&mdash;who is helpless and in bed&mdash;with his own weapons.</p>

<p><i>April 14, 1811.</i> <cite>Nursing the Spawn of a Tyrant, or Frenchmen Sick of the
Breed.</cite> Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;The Empress of the French is in consternation
at the precocious fury of her progeny, who, with an orb in one hand and a
dagger in the other, is threatening destruction around; while the Emperor is
listening behind a curtain; the pope and other Roman-Catholic hierarchs are
offering 'composing draughts,' and suggesting to send the infantine monster to
his supposed diabolical 'grandpapa' as quickly as possible. The Empress is
thus proclaiming the terrors of her situation: 'There's no condition sure so curst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_205" id="Page_ii_205">[205]</a></span>
as mine! Day and night to dandle such a dragon&mdash;the little angry cur snarls
while it feeds; see how the blood is settled in his scarecrow face; what brutal
mischief sits upon his brow. Rage and vengeance sparkle in his cheeks; the
very spawn and spit of its tyrant father. Nay, now I look again, he is the very
picture of his grandfather, <em>the Devil</em>!'</p>

<p><i>April 20, 1811.</i> <cite>The Enraged Son of Mars and the Timid Tonsor.</cite> Published
by T. Tegg (67).&mdash;The picture represents the interior of a barber's shop,
a favourite subject with the caricaturists. A stout customer is expressing
slaughterous intentions; a choleric old boy, probably an officer of the Militia,
with the shaving-cloth round his short neck, is vowing vengeance on the head
of the frightened barber, who has been so <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maladroit</i> as to carve a tolerable gash
in the veteran's round cheek. The tonsor's wife, who is also engaged in the
business, is, while holding the soap-bowl and lather, thrown into consternation
at the uproar raised by the damaged client. An assistant, who is employed in
cutting the hair of another customer, is equally distracted, and, in his trepidation,
is threatening the ears of his unconscious subject. The barber's monkey&mdash;for
barbers have in all time enjoyed the credit of being fanciers of live stock&mdash;is
lathering his head at a toilette-table, in imitation of the actions of a venerable
personage who has just had his head shaved. Various blocks, with their attendant
wigs, are ranged round the shelves of the shop, telling of the day when
a gentleman's head of hair was sent out to be dressed, while he kept a change of
wigs for convenience-sake; here we find parsons' blocks, clerks' blocks, doctors'
blocks, lawyers' blocks, and other professional 'caxons,' the heads of the learned
being distinguished by their respective wigs. Various sketches appear on the
walls, the subjects being selected with a view to their trade appositeness. One
picture represents the fate of Absalom, delivered to destruction by his luxuriant
locks: 'O Absalom, my son, my son! hadst thou wore a wig this ne'er had
happened,' &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>April 24, 1811.</i> <cite>Rural Sports. Cat in a Bowl.</cite> No. 1.&mdash;The pastimes of
our forefathers, before the establishment of Humane Societies for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, were too frequently of a barbarous description, and the
cruelties then tolerated for mere sport were undoubtedly most reprehensible.
The caricaturist has contrived to surround these wanton displays with an air of
hilarity, and the spectacle of a 'cat in a bowl,' apart from the brutality of the
fun, is not without its whimsical attractions. A favourite cat, the property of a
distracted spinster, has been launched upon the water in a bowl, which is shown
spinning round with the current, to the terror of the involuntary voyager, whose
dread of immersion combined with her exertions to escape from this embarrassing
situation, which threatens to capsize the treacherous craft at every turn, seem to
afford the frivolous audience unqualified amusement. A lad is seated on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_206" id="Page_ii_206">[206]</a></span>
bank, with a girl by his side&mdash;probably the authors of the mischief&mdash;holding a
barking dog, ready to attack the frightened creature if she comes too near the
shore. Parties taking the air in chaises, and promenaders, the loiterers from
the alehouse, pipe in hand, and various rustic groups gathered round the brink,
are intensely diverted at the scene. Not so the owner of the cat; the horrified
old maid, rendered desperate by the precarious situation of her pet, is pulling up
her skirts and plunging forward in a vain endeavour to reach the slippery bowl,
which is out of her reach; while a second old lady is doing her best to assist her
friend. A little further down the bank the artist has introduced another reckless
episode; a pair of horses are running away with a tandem, which is being overturned,
and the driver and a stout female by his side are just on the point of
being tumbled out without ceremony.</p>

<p><i>May 1, 1811.</i> <a href="#DOG_FIGHT"><cite>A Dog Fight.</cite></a>&mdash;There is a note on the proof impression of
this plate in the writer's collection, to the effect that the print was never published.
The spectacle represented is remarkably animated; the various incidents
of the brutal exhibition are seized with a masterly hand; the enthusiasm and
excitement of the audience are done full justice to. Drinking, betting, squabbling,
an irregular scrimmage, picking of pockets, and similar humours are
treated with due appreciation. The backers of the losing dog are thrown into
dismay, as their faces sufficiently indicate; while the satisfaction which fills the
supporters of the winning side is well expressed. The spirit of the picture is
much increased by the introduction of numerous dogs, ferocious-looking 'varmints,'
struggling to join the fray, and only held back from the stage of conflict
by the most desperate exertions on the part of their owners; these combatively-minded
animals are probably the heroes of coming tournays. The scene of this
cruel sport, since made unlawful, is probably the 'Westminster pit,'
<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> where such
spectacles were constantly held, and attended by persons of rank and fashion, as
well as by the dregs of the sporting and dog-fancying fraternities, whose presence,
as shown in the study, is tolerably marked.</p>

figure of the fair practitioner is highly spirited,&mdash;a handsome young female,
whose person is set off with all the allurements of fine clothes, well-dressed
hair, and waving plumes. A decrepit and toothless patient is evidently grateful
to the doctress; he is filling the hand of the distinguished physician with
gold-pieces before she leaves the apartment, or more properly consulting-room,
which is further set off with a picture of Danae collecting a shower of gold.</p>

<p><i>August 20, 1811.</i> <cite>Love Laughs at Locksmiths.</cite> Designed and published by
T. Rowlandson, 1 James Street, Adelphi.&mdash;The stronghold in which an old
Israelite has confined his treasure has enormous padlocks on the area gate and
the door studded with nails. The proprietor has returned with provisions for a
merry-making; a porter bearing on his head a basket containing geese, fowls, fish,
and fruit, with a flask of wine in his hand. The old curmudgeon's crutch is
leaning against the door, and he is fumbling over the immense padlock, quite
unconscious that a smart young officer, who has placed a ladder against the
window of his lovely inamorata's apartment, is helping the captive bird to
freedom from the clutches of her jealous jailer.</p>

<p><i>August 30, 1811.</i> <a href="#MASQUERADING"><cite>Masquerading.</cite></a> Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;The comicalities
of a masquerade at the beginning of the century, when this class of entertainment,
although declining since the palmy days of the Pantheon and Madame
Cornely's extravagances in Soho Square, was more prevalent than at present,
are set forth with due observation of the leading characteristics. Prominent
among the maskers is a lady-magician, with her divining-wand and a book of
the 'black art,' confronting a nondescript necromancer and his zany. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_210" id="Page_ii_210">[210]</a></span>
is a nobleman wearing horns as a becoming decoration for his head; and our old
friend Punchinello, with a guitar, putting himself into grotesque contortions.
There is a composite personage, a kind of <em>Janus</em>, an established feature in old
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bal masqu&eacute;s</i>, one side male and the other female. There is a Folly, a councillor,
and the usual attendance of dominos, masquers, and characters, whose
disguises are of a speculative description.</p>

the feet of a gigantic and finely-built wench is a rotund yet diminutive
Admiral, with cocked-hat, telescope, sword, and all complete; his broad
riband is marked <em>Death or Victory</em>. For his accommodation, that he may be
able to reach her countenance within hailing distance, the lady, who is more
than twice the height of her admirer, is holding a ladder ready for his ascent.
The belle wears a gallant plume, and a streamer with the motto <em>England expects
every man to do his duty</em>.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_211" id="Page_ii_211">[211]</a></span>
through a spyglass. A comely young female, seated in an armchair at the
window, is pointing out the phenomenon to the gazer; meanwhile a youthful
gallant, on his knees beside the lady, is squeezing her hand, tenderly pressing her
foot, and otherwise striving to enlist her interest by a demonstrative display of
affection.</p>

<p><i>September 25, 1811.</i> <cite>Life and Death of the Race Horse.</cite> Published by
T. Tegg (90).&mdash;This print is divided into six stages. The first represents
the foal by the side of his dam; in the second he is pictured as a racer on the
course in all the pride of strength and beauty, blood and limb. In the third
stage he has come down to a hunter; from thence, with old age fast approaching,
he is used to run in a postchaise. In the fifth plate we find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_212" id="Page_ii_212">[212]</a></span>
whilom racehorse grown aged and broken down, and condemned to end his
wretched days belaboured as a pack-horse. In the last stage the racehorse's
career is brought down to his death, and a huntsman has purchased his carcass
to feed his pack.</p>

<p><i>September 29, 1811.</i> <cite>Rural Sports. A Milling Match which took place at
Thisselton Gap, in the county of Rutland, September 28, 1811, betwixt Cribb
and Molineaux, on a twenty-five foot stage, and was the second public contest
between these two pugilists. It lasted nineteen minutes and ten seconds, and
was decisive in favour of Cribb.</cite> Rowlandson del. Published by T. Tegg.&mdash;The
point from which the picture is taken affords a good view of the combat,
which is about concluded. Cribb, a massively-built boxer, is dealing the black
champion such a felling blow as, judging from the dismay expressed in the faces
of the two supporters of Molineaux, one of whom is also a man of colour, will
leave the victory in the hands of the striker, whose backer and bottle-holder are
in raptures. Round the raised platform which constitutes the ring is gathered
a very animated throng, amidst which the artist has depicted the various popular
incidents of pushing, struggling, climbing on shoulders, quarrelling, picking
pockets, cheering, and resenting the encroachments of men on horseback. A
prize-fight would seem to have been an institution in fashion at the beginning
of the century; the streams of vehicles, coaches, tandems, curricles, and every
contrivance 'on wheels' which surround the stage and line the background give
the scene the appearance of a Derby course. The presence of the fair sex, who
seem to appreciate the performance, keeps up the animation of the picture.</p>

<p><i>October, 1811.</i> <cite>Rural Sports, or a Game at Quoits.</cite>&mdash;A village green, with an
alehouse in the rear, is the scene of this diversion. Various loving couples are
disporting themselves on benches and at round-tables by the alehouse door.
The village cobblers, blacksmiths, tailors, butchers, &amp;c., are neglecting their
trades to follow the game; their injured wives have come to reduce the careless
husbands to a proper sense of their duties. One shrewish spouse, leaning over
the paling, is flourishing a broom with a force of arms that threatens to astonish
her good man, whose attention is occupied in the game. Over the head of the
victim is a board, <em>Washing and mangling done here</em>. Various convivial groups are
scattered around.</p>

<p><i>October, 1811.</i> <cite>Rural Sports, or how to show off a well-shaped Leg</cite>, introduces
a rustic pleasure-ground. A rope thrown between two tall trees furnishes a
swing for a well-developed and gaily apparelled hoyden; another maiden is
working the rope which swings her friend; the attractions of the second lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_213" id="Page_ii_213">[213]</a></span>
have absorbed a young gentleman, whose attentions to the fair rope-puller are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_214" id="Page_ii_214">[214]</a></span>
'particular.' A group of wicked old roysterers are delighted with the prospect
of the swinging hoyden&mdash;their pipes and bowls are neglected in their rapturous
attention to the evolutions of the fair occupant of the swing, and their indignant
wives are vainly endeavouring to recall them to a sense of propriety.</p>

<p><i>October, 1811.</i> <cite>Rural Sports, or a Cricket Match Extraordinary.</cite> Published
by T. Tegg (96).&mdash;On Wednesday, Oct. 3, 1811, a cricket match took place at
Balls Pond, Newington. The players on both sides were women&mdash;11 Hampshire
against 11 Surrey. The match was made between two noblemen amateurs
of the respective counties for 500 guineas a side. The performers in the contest
were of all ages and sizes. Such a subject in the hands of Rowlandson afforded
almost unbounded opportunities for the exercise of his grotesque talents and his
command of figure-drawing. The scene is a busy one, as may be conceived; a
certain artistic freedom has been assumed, and there is a liberal display of limbs
in all directions, the skirts of the cricketers being tucked up for convenience of
motion; the performers, however, seem to enter into the contest with spirit, if not
skill. Balls Pond, as seen in the engraving, is a fair open country, without a
trace of a solitary habitation. A spacious tent, in the background, is erected for
the <em>Jolly Cricketers</em>, wherein the noble patrons of the sport are fortifying the
players with huge bowls of punch, restoratives which do not appear to promote
the most orderly proceedings.</p>

Tegg (112).&mdash;The preparations of the cook in question are not calculated to
increase the appetite of the observant epicure; the <em>chef</em> is hideous, old, rheumy,
slovenly, and diseased; he is kneading the paste with his objectionable hands,
his snuffbox is on the board by his side; while a blowsy and uncombed slattern
is reaching down a pie-dish, in which the rats have been revelling; the bold
depredators are scampering off no farther than the next dish. (Companion to <cite>Distillers

<p><i>October 25, 1811.</i> <cite>A Trip to Gretna Green.</cite> Designed and published by
T. Rowlandson, 1 James Street, Adelphi.&mdash;The scene of the situation is the
green at Gretna, before the shed of <em>Tim Tag, 'Blacksmith and Rector.'</em> The
worthy is in his clerical character, decently clad in professional sables; and, with
spectacles on nose, he is reading the service, in a somewhat extemporary fashion,
over a fugitive couple, in the open air. A dashing captain, dressed in his
regimentals, as was then the everyday fashion in the King's service, is placing a
ring on the finger of a comely maiden of tender years, who is smiling and blushing.
The postilion who has driven the runaway pair to this stolen match is standing,
cap in hand, grinning at the ceremonial. While the blacksmith is rivetting the
fetters of Hymen in his clerical character, his professional helpers are looking to
the shoes of the horses which are to bear the newly-married couple across the
Border.</p>

<p><i>October 25, 1811.</i> <cite>Rural Sports. Balloon Hunting.</cite> Published by T. Tegg
(157).&mdash;The balloon is drifting before the wind beyond the control of the
aeronaut; a fair voyager is making a terrific descent with a parachute in the
midst of a flock of birds; from the top of a tall tower a gentleman is taking
deliberate aim at the flying machine, probably with a view to bring it down by
blowing a hole through the body of the balloon. In the foreground is shown
the mishap of the balloon-hunters; a stout old gentleman is endeavouring to
drag his vehicle up hill; his horse is shying and kicking; a dog is barking at the
animal's head, the shafts are snapped, and the trap is kicked over; three fair riders
are thrown out in picturesque confusion on the turf, and scattered with bottles
and a bundle.</p>

Street.&mdash;'Lord Charles Manners was a famous horseman, and unexpectedly one
day came upon a French cavalry picket, who gave chase until a brook was
reached, which Lord Charles immediately cleared, making a salute, and bidding
the Frenchmen (who were so surprised as not to fire until too late), '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adieu,

foregoing record of the exciting incident. This gallant exploit is treated pictorially
by Rowlandson. Lord Charles Manners is taking the brook in an easy stride,
his horse bearing him over 'like a bird,' while his ferocious-looking pursuers are
brought to a full stop at the brink, and as the daring horseman is bidding farewell
to the enemy they are nonplussed with astonishment at the reckless feat,
which they have no ambition to follow. There is a disappointed knot of French
officers, dragoons, huzzars, &amp;c.; they are all uttering ejaculations of surprise and
cursing the fugitive: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">'Sacrebleu!' 'Mais comment, &amp;c.'; 'Quel diable d'Anglois!'

Bell, in wig, gown, cassock, and bands, is standing calmly before a very terrific

shines the glorious midday sun, figuratively set forth&mdash;is extended the buckler of
<em>Religion</em> held by the stalwart arm of the <em>Marsh Clergy of Monarchists</em>. Dr.
Bell is pointing triumphantly to his school, a dignified pile, founded on a commanding
eminence, marked <em>Church and State</em>. Behind 'the Dragon' is the
rival establishment, <em>Lancaster's School under the Broad-brim System</em>, raised on
<em>Deceit and Misrepresentation</em>. The Dragon's tongue, labelled <em>Falsehood</em>, is
pouring forth smoke and flames, and his claws, <em>Hypocrisy</em>, <em>Vanity</em>, <em>Misrepresentation</em>,
and <em>Calumny</em>, are extended to maul the reputation of the opposition

at one of the Universities; the shameless undergraduate, in cap and gown, has
waited his opportunity, and as the buxom wench is passing his open casement he
is leaning out of window, throwing his arm round her buxom waist, and is indulging
in a chaste salute, which is cordially received. A tutor, or proctor, dodging
round 'the quad,' is horrified at the scandalous licence; a sturdy infant is carried
in one of the pails, the other is filled with cream, and offers a rare opportunity
for plunder, of which a passing dog is not slow to avail himself&mdash;raised on his
hind legs he is lapping up the welcome fluid at his leisure.</p>

<p>1811 (?). <cite><a href="#EXHIBITION">Exhibition 'Stare' Case</a>, Somerset House.</cite>&mdash;The staircase of the
handsome buildings erected for Somerset House originally set apart for the Exhibition
of the Royal Academy, is ridiculed as a scene of unequivocal confusion.
Whether the dangers of the somewhat steep ascent were actually as hazardous
as the artist has depicted is open to question. It will be remembered that Sir
William Chambers, the architect, whose masterpiece was decidedly Somerset
House, was a member of the Royal Academy, and held the office of Treasurer
to that body. It was somewhat the fashion of the wits to laugh at the architect,
who, as a foreigner, had received an amount of royal patronage which created
certain jealousies in the minds of his English rivals, who were less favoured with
the smiles of princes. Chambers' extravagant conceptions, the various novel
designs he published, and particularly his marked taste for so-called Oriental
gardening and the introduction of buildings after the Chinese fashion, exposed
the project to an ordeal of the severest criticism and sarcasm. George the
Third employed Sir William Chambers to lay out and adorn the Royal gardens
at Kew, when the eminent Swede took advantage of the occasion to carry out
the taste he had acquired in China
<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>&mdash;an indulgence which subjected the architect
to numerous well-merited satires. The famous 'Heroic Epistle to Sir William
Chambers' was provoked on this occasion.</p>

<p>Peter Pindar, according to his custom, found various faults with the new pile
of buildings in the Strand, and their shortcomings were pointed out with his
habitual archness.</p>

<p>The scene of disaster and tumultuous medley which Rowlandson has ventured
to introduce as attendant incidents of the Royal Academy staircase must have
assisted, in some degree, to make this portion of the building a laughing-stock
with the more frivolous portion of the frequenters.</p>

<p>The Editor acknowledges the situation is treated with a licence which,
perhaps, may be held to verge on the inadmissible. It has been sufficiently
difficult, in selecting these illustrations, to keep within the restrictions marked out

by modern decorum, too chaste to endorse the broad jocularity which passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_219" id="Page_ii_219">[219]</a></span>
current half a century back. The mirth imported into <em>Somerset House</em> is not,
however, of a licentious description; if the subject is treated with more freedom
than is desirable, according to the juster ideas of our generation, at least its
humours are innoxious and, we trust, guiltless of offence.</p>

</div>

<p>It is obvious that, in an instance like the present, the task becomes one of
extreme delicacy; it is impossible to translate the caprices of the artist by any
method short of the etching-needle; the mixed description of the spectacle and
the spirit of the <em>contretemps</em> defy a mere verbal rendering; and the caricature is
too excellent in other respects to be passed over in the present collection, which
professes to give a general view of the artist's cleverest and most familiarly
known examples. While avoiding instances the morality of which is absolutely
questionable, it is evident that it would be impossible to treat of the actual history,
let alone the novels and caricatures of our forefathers, or to venture on the merest
enquiry into their familiar life, abroad or at home, unless we put prudery a little
on one side.</p>

<p>1811. <cite><a href="#MANAGERS">The Manager's Last Kick</a>, or a New Way to Pay Old Debts.</cite> Published
by T. Tegg (117).&mdash;An episode in theatrical management is made the
subject of the present caricature. As is well known, pecuniary complications were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_220" id="Page_ii_220">[220]</a></span>
occasionally attendant evils of carrying on theatrical enterprises, especially some
half a century ago. Sheridan's monetary difficulties were notorious, and although
the holders of writs had recourse to expedients without end to serve the slippery
manager of Drury Lane, it is just to add that 'Sherry's' ingenuity was frequently
equal to the emergency. During a rehearsal at Drury Lane a Sheriff's officer by
some subterfuge gained admittance to the stage, and presented the manager with
his objectionable scrip of parchment. Sheridan was by no means disconcerted,
but made the process-server at home, asking his advice on various points; and
finally, as the story goes, having thrown the man off his guard, he induced him
to mount to the front of the house to give his opinion on the sounding properties
of the building. 'Can you hear me?' asked Sheridan. 'Perfectly,' replied the
man. 'Then,' said Sheridan, 'you had better lose no time in coming down
again, and catch me if you can, for I'm off!' And before the disconcerted bailiff
could find his way back to the stage his charge had succeeded in making good
his retreat.</p>

<p>In <cite><a href="#MANAGERS">The Manager's Last Kick</a>, or a New Way to Pay Old Debts</cite>, the same
principle is involved; in this case, however, just as the <em>red tail</em> writ is being
served on the manager, a stage trap-door is suddenly let down, and the objectionable
visitor is whisked off the scene. The wily lessee is bowing his fallen enemy
out of sight with mock respect: 'Good morning, Mr. Catchpole; you'll find more
of your tribe when you get to the bottom!'</p>

<p>1811. <cite>A Barber's Shop.</cite> H. Bunbury del., Rowlandson sculp.&mdash;Two
customers, already polished off, are putting on their cravats at the glass, and a
stout old gentleman is in a shaving-chair having his hair dressed. A brace of
dogs are quarrelling over a wig, which they are worrying like a rat and pulling
different ways. A client is being lathered and is under operation, while a gentleman,
who has been shaved, is wiping off the remains of the soapsuds. This
design, one of the latest due to the hand of the gifted Henry Bunbury,
<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> was also
engraved on a larger scale by James Gillray: it was the last plate upon which
he was able to work, and it proceeded but slowly, being touched in rare lucid
intervals as his increasing madness permitted.</p>

<p>The etching, as executed by Gillray, bears the date 1811 in one corner, and
to this is added the date of its deferred publication, May 15, 1818. The title
given on the folio engraving is <cite>Interior of a Barber's Shop in Assize Time</cite>. The
great caricaturist carried this plate, <em>the last work on copper by the hand of Gillray</em>,
as notified upon the print, so far as his intermittent returns of reason would allow
him. As Gillray died June 1, 1815, when the plate was evidently unfinished, this
is probably one of the caricaturist's coppers which, as we have already related,
were handed to George Cruikshank, another departed worthy, to complete. The
unexpected death of the veteran has prevented the writer verifying this circumstance,
although it is probably one of the plates&mdash;probably the most important as
to size&mdash;which Cruikshank held in recollection when he informed the writer he
considered that the most flattering testimonial which had been paid him in his
long life was being selected, while a young man, to complete the engravings
Gillray had left unfinished under the painful circumstances of his mental aberration,
as already detailed. (See <cite>The Works of James Gillray, the Caricaturist,
with the Story of his Life and Times</cite>, page 19, Introduction; and, further, the
reduced engraving, from this plate (1811), page 370, the <cite>Works</cite>).</p>

<p>1811 (?). <cite>Modern Antiques.</cite>&mdash;The cabinet of an antiquarian, richly filled
with supposititious relics of the past. On a shelf is a row of Etruscan vases;
bacchic masks and terminal gods are ranged on the walls; the chief features
of the collection are a gathering of Egyptian deities and some magnificent
sarcophagi. The satire, in some degree, seems to hint at Sir William Hamilton
(then deceased) and the fair Emma.</p>

<p>An old antiquary, decrepit and bent, is peering at the shapely proportions of
an Egyptian figure bearing a close resemblance to life. The chief incident of
the picture is centred in a mummy's coffin, tenanted for the time, like a
sentry-box, by a gallant young officer, who is embraced, behind the lid of
his temporary resting-place, by a lady, who, like all the beauties designed by
the artist, is represented of fine proportions and somewhat free graces. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_224" id="Page_ii_224">[224]</a></span>

purpose, <cite>Loves of the Gods&mdash;embellished with cuts</cite>, and she is taking the opportunity
to make a practical application of her readings.</p>

to pass the gutter without injury to her stockings. The point of view is supposed
to be taken from the junction of Petticoat Lane with Smock Alley. Scavengers
are shovelling mud into their carts; and the general downpour is further aggravated
by denizens of the upper floors, who are discharging vessels over the
soaked and dripping passengers below.</p>

in three subjects which are hanging over the head of the victim: 'the fair sex&mdash;drinking&mdash;and
gaming,' being the evils set down to avoid. The novice is evidently
well advanced on the downward route, and has fallen among experienced professors
of the plucking process. A gaily-dressed lady by his side, a 'decoy duck,' of captivating
exterior, is beguiling the senses of the self-satisfied dupe with various familiarities;
while a smug stout person, dressed like a parson, is discreetly keeping up
the spirit of the affair by filling the glasses and manufacturing fresh supplies of
punch, which the 'spooney' is imbibing freely and without regard to the consequences.
A pile of gold and notes has been laid on the table by this very
innocent pigeon, and opposite to him sits the crafty and accomplished 'rook'&mdash;a
captain, from his 'keeping'&mdash;who, by a skilful manipulation of the cards, assisted

in their own fashion a day set apart by the Church for general mortification.
The portly four are seated at a well-furnished board, and trains of servants are,
with respectful attention, bringing in fresh supplies&mdash;poultry, dainty meats,
and other delicacies. The well-stocked collegiate cellars have been laid under
contribution; bottles of choice vintage are standing in wine-coolers and in
promising rows on the floor, beside a liberal jorum of punch in a <em>Bowl for a
Bishop</em>. The nature of the private meditations of these epicurean worthies is
thus made manifest, while the order of the repast is further set forth in a lengthy
<em>bill of fare</em> irreverently written on a <em>New Form of Prayer for the Fast Day</em>, by
way of <em>menu</em>. The walls are suggestively hung with <em>Lists of the Great Tithes</em>
and such congenial paintings as <em>A Bench of Bishops</em>, represented regaling at a

<span class="i0">Want is the scorn of every wealthy fool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And genius in rags is turned to ridicule.&mdash;<cite>Vide 'Satirist.'</cite><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The apartment of an enthusiastic genius, whose ambitions seem to have taken
various forms of expression. Music, painting, sculpture, literature, chemistry,
and other arts and sciences seem to have occupied his attention by turns,
and instruments suggestive of the respective pursuits are muddled up with
domestic details incidental to the confinement of a wife and family to one
solitary chamber, together with the utensils of cookery, besides the food itself.
The genius has left his rest under the impulse of an inspiration; he has an old
nightcap worn over his wig, and is still in his night-shirt, with down-at-heel
slipper on one foot, and a ragged stocking on the other. He is seated, in an
attitude expressive of sudden exaltation before an easel which bears the canvas
he is filling out with rapid energy; his left hand grasps a pen, and a black cat in
demanding attention has fixed her claws in his unclad limbs; but the artist is so
absorbed in his subject as to be unconscious of pain; miscellaneous litter, a bust,
a palette, and a sheaf of brushes, paint-pots, a still and furnace, books, scales,
syringes, a fiddle, and a post horn are scattered behind the easel. The female
companion of this genius is tranquilly sleeping in an easy attitude through all
the confusion; on the table by the bedstead (on which her husband's garments
are displayed) is a coffee-pot and some suggestions of breakfast; an unclad infant
is leaning over the table, and pouring gin into a wineglass. Another semiclad
child is seated on a tub before a blazing fire, amusing herself with the bellows,
and is in danger from a steaming kettle and a red-hot poker. Food, knives,
forks, plates, and a pewter quart-pot are at the artist's feet; he has just kicked
over a large porringer of milk, and is heedless of the mischief. Lamps, caudle-boats,
strings of candles, and bunches of onions are the decorations of the
chimneypiece; ragged clothes and unmended stockings are hanging over a rope
stretched across the chamber; on the wall is hung a smart three-cornered hat
and a sword by the side of pictures of 'Aerostation' and the portraits of a ballet-dancer
and 'Peter Tester.'</p>

<p>Rowlandson has put his own name to the print as the 'inventor;' the satire
is very unsparing, and the squalor he has attributed to his professional brother
is of the direst and most ludicrous description, but the figure of the painter is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_228" id="Page_ii_228">[228]</a></span>
marked with vigorous characteristics, and the outline of the face which he has
bestowed on his erratic genius, designedly or not, bears a suggestive resemblance
to his own strongly-defined features.</p>

if need be to offer fictitious sums in opposition to 'Milord' and spur his enthusiasm

go. A sensuous Magdalen, attributed to Guido, is exciting the admiration of the
party and employing the wily dealer's eloquence. Around are supposititious
examples of Rubens, Carracci, Titian, Teniers, Salvator Rosa, and other 'undoubted
originals,' the major part of which in all probability owe their well-disguised
paternity to the versatile 'Van Daub.'</p>

Woodward delin., Rowlandson sculp.&mdash;An old salt, with his dog at his elbow, is
seated beside his blooming daughter-in-law, a pretty young mother, dandling a
fine infant; the lady is using her eloquence and trying to flatter this obdurate
relative into confidence in her story. The experienced mariner is declaring,
'Why, d'ye see, I am an old seaman, and not easily imposed upon. I say that
can't be my son Jack's child. Why, he has not been married but three months, and
during that time he has been at sea&mdash;the thing is impossible! You may as well
tell me that my ship Nancy goes nine knots an hour in a dead calm. And now I
look again it's the very picture of Peter Wilkins, the soap-boiler.'</p>

<p>The fair object of suspicion is by no means confounded at this logical deduction.
'My dear father-in-law, I'll make it out very easily&mdash;Jack has been
married to me three months,&mdash;very well,&mdash;I have been with child three months,&mdash;which
makes <em>six</em>,&mdash;then he has been at sea three months, has not he?&mdash;and
that just makes up the <em>nine</em>!'</p>

<p>The fortunate husband, who sports a new rig-out&mdash;with a bright bandanna
round his neck, and his pipe stuck in the band of his hat&mdash;is lurching into the
apartment with a sea-roll. He is quite satisfied with his wife's arithmetic, and
is arguing on the side of his tender partner: 'Father, father, don't be too hard
upon Poll; I know something about the logbook myself, and dash me but she
has kept her reckoning like a true seaman's wife!'</p>

A postman becomes a 'man of letters.' A gardener is raised to a
'Master of the Mint.' A Jew hawker, who cries, 'Any old clothes to shell?' is

Regaling</cite>, was, it seems likely, designed as a companion to <cite>Love and Dust</cite> (1792,
&amp;c.), and it partakes of the same ragged inspiration. In the hovel tenanted by
the somewhat undesirable 'Chummey family' smoke is the prevalent element; the
sooty company, sufficiently black and begrimed in their own persons, seem perfectly
in their element before a smoking fireplace&mdash;as they are reposing luxuriously
on sacks of soot. The heads of the family are amiably sharing their enjoyments,
drinking beer from a pewter measure, and smoking long clay pipes; the sweeper
lads, but for a coat of soot comparatively unclad, are revelling amidst the cinders
on the hearth, divided between the congenial relaxations of eating porridge and
tormenting an unfortunate cat. Brushes, shovels, and the professional belongings
of chimney-sweeping are scattered about; the only article of fancy admitted into
the establishment is a blackbird, which is possibly present on the ground that
its hue offers a resemblance to the general complexion.</p>

<p>Rowlandson's print introduces the nobleman at the precise moment his
affairs need 'patching up,' for 'mended' he never can be after he has put
himself into the spider-like clutches of plausible Isaac and his 'friend in the
City.' The 'little Jew broker' has brought a rich usurer of his tribe, and
between them his lordship's career of folly will be swiftly run. All the ready-money
is gone, and the racing stud has followed it; but the 'road to ruin' is
only just opening up. The spendthrift is a comparative beginner; the next
step is raising money on his <em>title deeds</em>, which are undergoing inspection under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_235" id="Page_ii_235">[235]</a></span>
the vulture-like eye of the scrivener, who, it appears, lends money on good security
and traffics in annuities and jointures.</p>

<p>The borrower is evidently accustomed to take life easily, he is putting
himself into the claws of the Israelites, and is otherwise 'going to the bad' with
perfect good humour and in a sociable frame of mind, not unlike the way of
proceeding practised by the heroes of Sheridan's comedies; indeed, there is a
great deal of the <em>Charles Surface</em> element in the composition.</p>

<p>The pictures which fill young Hopeful's walls tell his story after the Hogarthian
method. There are portraits of the relatives who have left their savings
and estates to the present careless holder: Sir Matthew Mite, a miser; Lady
Crane; and Sir Peter Plumb&mdash;all persons of a 'warm' disposition as to wealth.
There is a 'view of the Yorkshire estate;' then there is 'The Prodigal Son,' which
may be held to apply to the heir, whose ways of making the money fly are
further illustrated by such pictures as a 'Hazard Table,' 'A game fighting-cock,'
a racehorse, 'Sancho,' on the course; and a blood mare, 'Diana,' and foal; the
breeding and running of racehorses being considered then, as now, among the
most expeditious routes to insolvency.</p>

<p><i>November 30, 1812.</i> <cite>Christmas Gambols.</cite> Published by T. Rowlandson, 1

and frolicsome description, are taking place in the servants' hall. Full drinking
has been the order of the evening; the master's cellar and the servants' heads
have both been lightened simultaneously, and the results are displaying themselves
under the mistletoe and in horseplay. A footman and a parlour-maid are
rolling over one another indiscriminately on the hearthrug amidst the fragments
of crockery demolished in their downfall. A sturdy black footman is lifting a
fat wench in his arms for a chaste salute. Practical joking is the order of the
evening; the fat cook has been toppled back in her armchair, and is vainly
flourishing her basting-ladle to drive off her assailant, while her feet are in
the air; and the butler, as author of the mischief, is making the best use of his
opportunities, while another couple are exchanging kisses with evident goodwill.</p>

the regular frequenters of Bath, sufferers from gout on crutches, and invalids
in wheeled-chairs. A dashing Irish adventurer, one of the bold fortune-hunters&mdash;notorieties
from the Sister Isle in Rowlandson's day&mdash;is leading
captive the wealth and person of a somewhat vulgar and stumpy heiress,
whose figure is loaded with jewellery fashioned on a scale of oppressive magnitude.</p>

From erasures in the date of this plate it seems probable that it was originally
issued ten years earlier. As the title indicates, this sketch is a broad burlesque
of the deportment displayed by the frequenters of a suburban ball-room. The
awkward and ungainly carriage of all the figures is amusingly exaggerated. A
master of the ceremonies, the expression of whose features is complicated by a
decided squint, is briskly performing the rites of his office and introducing a
cobby little gentleman as a partner to an angular and misshapen spinster, who,
in consulting <em>the graces</em>, has thrown her Gothic frame into an absurdly constrained
and affected posture.</p>

low, bonnet in hand, the Scot is throwing himself on the clemency of the court:
'I own, your honour, I was a little inebriated, but your worship knows <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nemo
mortalium omnibus hooris saupit</i>.' 'What's that you say, fellow,' retorts the
magistrate, 'about a sawpit?&mdash;a very improper place to go with such company.
I wonder you are not ashamed to mention such a thing, and before my wife too.
But, however, as it is your first offence, I will discharge you this time; but never
come here with such a story again!'</p>

<p>1812 (?). <cite>Preaching to some Purpose.</cite>&mdash;An open-air meeting of rustic worshippers.
Great astonishment is pictured on the upturned faces of the expectant
congregation. The preacher is raised on an extemporised pulpit; he is clad in
black, but in the rear of his nether garment appears a formidable rent, which his
hand is not sufficiently broad to conceal. He is earnestly addressing his perplexed
hearers to the following purpose: 'Dearly beloved, before I begin my
discourse, I have three things to inform you of. The first thing I know, and
you do not know. The next thing you know, and I do not know,&mdash;and the third
thing none of us know, viz., in my way here to preach, crossing Farmer
Hobson's stile, I tore my breeches,&mdash;the extent of the rent I know, and you do
not know. Secondly, what you are willing to subscribe to get them repaired you
know, and I do not know. And lastly, what Tim Snip, the tailor, will charge for
the job, <em>that none of us know</em>!'</p>

physician's advice&mdash;the practitioner is one of the old school&mdash;full-bottomed
wig, powder, and pigtail, a learnedly long-skirted square-cut suit, lace frill and
ruffles, huge spectacles, and a professional gold-headed cane held up to the nose;
he is standing on the hearthrug, warming his learned back at the fireplace;
above the mantelpiece is a bust of Galen. The patients, who are evidently
robust country folks, thus set forth their case:&mdash;'Do you see, Doctor, my dame
and I be come to ax your advice&mdash;we both of us eat well,    and drink well, and
sleep well,&mdash;yet still we be somehow queerish!' The Doctor is equal to the
emergency and prepared to alter all this promptly. 'You eat well, you drink
well, and you sleep well,&mdash;very good. You were perfectly right in coming to me,
for depend upon it I will give you something that shall do away with all these
things!'</p>

flight and throwing a light on the subject with a chamber candle which he is
holding out of the bedroom window. The partner of the elopement is an officer;
he is precipitated on to his back, and forms a convenient cushion to receive the
lady's fall, which is complete and overwhelming. A postchaise, prepared for
the flight, is seen in the distance; the postilion is enjoying the spectacle
of his employer's downfall; and the moon, peeping over a cloud, is represented
with a broad grin on its face at the expense of these disconcerted 'fly-by-nights.'</p>

certainly bears a close resemblance to that of a cat, is shuffling along in
the breeze on pattens; she has a boa and an enormous muff; before her trots
a French poodle, clipped fantastically to resemble a parody of a lion; behind her
shivers a black page, in a tight gaudy uniform; under his arm is his mistress's
umbrella, and he holds before him a bundle of cat's meat. A half-naked and

<p class="center smaller">London: J. J. Stockdale, 41 Pall Mall, Feb. 12, 1812. 4to.
</p>


<p>The argument upon which the story is founded is set forth in the following
'advertisement':&mdash;</p>

<p><cite>'Dublin Castle. The Adventure of the Under Petticoat at the Castle Drawing
Room. "Honi soit qui mal y pense."</cite> All the world has been amused with the
singular disaster that befel a lady on Thursday night last at the <em>Viceregal Palace</em>,
by the loss of her under petticoat, which, from the pressure of the crowd, unfortunately
slipped down through the capacious encumbrance of her hoop, and
was soon trampled on the floor&mdash;though likely to become as renowned as Penelope's
web: for the lady to whom it belonged lost by night the comfort and
protection that was her security by day. One of the young pages (who are
always peeping and bustling on such occasions) first made the discovery. The
trophy was soon displayed in order to find out the fair owner; which, however,
still remains a secret, except to the person immediately concerned. But, like the
shield of Achilles, the little petticoat soon became the subject of admiration and
contention.</p>

<p>'At the first impression the master of the ceremonies claimed the prize, as his
official perquisite, alleging it was dropped in the <em>Presence Chamber</em>. But the
Chamberlain insisted the drawing-room was his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">champ d'or</i>, and every windfall
on such occasions his exclusive property. That as a true knight he must take up
the gauntlet thus thrown down by a lady.</p>

<p>'The household troops, particularly the young <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aides-de-camp</i>, struggled
through the crowd to see the cause of such bustle; and having satisfied their
curiosity, whispered one another, and, in their usual way, set up a great titter.
The chaplain in waiting had his eye upon the petticoat, and said he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_239" id="Page_ii_239">[239]</a></span>
in decorum it ought to be deposited among the <em>new antiquities</em> in Bedford
Chapel.</p>

<p>'The Duke, with his usual good humour, liberality, and regard for the fair
creation, decided the contest by saying that it should be suspended as a banner
round the temple of love and beauty; and that as Edward the Third constituted
the Order of the Garter from a similar accident at the British Court, he would
solicit the Prince Regent, in the true spirit of chivalry, to establish and become
<em>Sovereign of the Order of the Petticoat</em> in Ireland, in commemoration of the
pleasant adventure,' &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center">TOUR OF DOCTOR SYNTAX IN SEARCH OF THE PICTURESQUE.</p>

<p>In 1812 the poem and illustrations of <cite>The Tour of Doctor Syntax in Search of
the Picturesque</cite> were issued as an independent volume, when the success with
which it was received was more decidedly marked than when it first appeared
in the <cite>Poetical Magazine</cite> under the title of <cite>The Schoolmaster's Tour</cite>. Five editions
were issued between 1812 and 1813.</p>

<p>The work was described as <cite>The Tour of Doctor Syntax in Search of the
Picturesque</cite>. A Poem. With new plates.</p>

<p>The old subjects, it appears, were re-engraved by Rowlandson's hand, with
but slight variations from the originals. The outlines are somewhat less bold, and
three new subjects are added; one being the frontispiece, which represents the
worthy Doctor at his desk, seated in his armchair, in deep cogitation, touching his
forehead as the idea of his famous <em>Picturesque Tour</em> suggests itself to his brain.
The window of his study is opened, that he may contemplate the exterior prospect
at his ease, while a sketch, by his own hand, in India-ink, is displayed before him.
Various papers and books are scattered about, with sundry objects which indicate
his versatile accomplishments&mdash;a fiddle hung on the wall, books of travel, sheets
of the Doctor's original treatise&mdash;<em>Every Man his own Farrier</em>&mdash;with a goodly
jar of <em>cherry bounce</em> to rejoice the learned man's spirits.</p>

<p>On the titlepage is engraved a quaint vignette of architectural relics, ruins,
a castle, &amp;c., the detached monuments being disposed so as to form the word
<em>Picturesque</em>.</p>

<p>The third addition is plate 27, in the body of the Tour, introducing <em>The
Doctor's Dream</em> (in his patron's library) <em>of the Battle of the Books</em>, which was
not included in the work on its original publication.</p>

<p>This edition is preceded by an Introduction, which in some degree explains
the relative positions&mdash;as far as the preparation of the work was concerned&mdash;of
the artist and William Combe, the author, who thus sets the matter before
his public: 'The following poem, if it may be allowed to deserve the name, was
written under circumstances whose peculiarity may be thought to justify a communication
of them. I undertook to give metrical illustrations of the prints with
which Mr. Ackermann decorated the <cite>Poetical Magazine</cite>, a work published by
him in monthly numbers, for the reception of original compositions. Many of
these engravings were miscellaneous, and those (which were, indeed, the far
greater part of them) whose description was submitted to such a muse as mine
represented views of interesting objects and beautiful scenery, or were occasional
decorations appropriate to the work. Those designs, to which this volume is so
greatly indebted, I was informed, would follow in a <em>series</em>, and it was proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_248" id="Page_ii_248">[248]</a></span>
to me to shape out a story from them. An etching, or a drawing, was accordingly
sent to me every month, and I composed a certain proportion of verse, in which,
of course, the subject of the design was included; the rest depended on what my
imagination could furnish. When the first print was sent to me I did not know
what would be the subject of the second; and in this manner, in a great measure,
the artist continued designing, and I continued writing, every month for two
years, till a work containing near ten thousand lines was produced; the artist
and the writer having no personal communication with or knowledge of each
other....</p>

<p>'Mr. Ackermann has his reasons for risking a republication of it in its present
form; and I now feel more than common solicitude that it should answer his
expectations.... <cite>The Battle of the Books</cite> was an after-thought, and forms the
novelty of this volume.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">Liberius si<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dixero quid, si forte jocosius; hoc mihi juris,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cum veni&acirc; dabis.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hor.</span> <i>S.</i> lib. i. v. 103.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>'I have only to add, that though, on a first view of some of the prints, it may
appear as if the clerical character were treated with levity, I am confident in
announcing a very opposite impression from a perusal of the work.'</p>

<p>The origin of <em>Doctor Syntax</em> is ascribed, with characteristic partiality, to John
Bannister, the comedian, by his biographer, John Adolphus.</p>

<p>'Of another graphic series, which owed its existence almost entirely to the
invention of Bannister, I have the following account:&mdash;Dining at a tavern, with
him and a third person, Rowlandson was asked, "What are you about, Rolly?"
"Why, nothing in particular," he said. "I think my inventive faculty has been
very sluggish of late; I wish one of you would give me a hint." Being asked of
what kind, he answered, "I feel in a humour to sketch a series where the object
may be made ridiculous without much thinking. I have been making a tour in
Cornwall and Devonshire with a friend, who, as I have made sketches on the
coast for him, wishes me to introduce adventures at inns, and other comic
incidents, in which he was the principal party. But what can I do for such a
hero?&mdash;a walking turtle&mdash;a gentleman weighing four-and-twenty stone&mdash;for
such scenes he is quite out of the question. I want one of a totally different
description." And he named a celebrated tourist, who by a recent publication
had given much celebrity to the Lakes.</p>

<p>'"I have it!" said Bannister. "You must fancy a skin-and-bone hero, a
pedantic old prig, in a shovel-hat, with a pony, sketching-stools, and rattletraps,
and place him in such scrapes as travellers frequently meet with&mdash;hedge alehouses,
second and third rate inns, thieves, gibbets, mad bulls, and the like. Come!" he
proceeded, warming with the subject, "give us a sheet of paper, and we'll strike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_249" id="Page_ii_249">[249]</a></span>
out a few hints." The paper was produced, Bannister gave his ideas, Rowlandson
adopted them, Combe explained them in a well-written poem; and to this
conversation and to the lively invention of Bannister the public is indebted for a
highly favoured publication, <cite>The Tour of Doctor Syntax</cite>.'</p>

<p>It is by no means improbable that Bannister's suggestion had something to
do with the eccentric personality of the hero of the <cite>Picturesque Tours</cite>; but the
author of the <cite>Memoir of John Bannister</cite> assumes too much when he records that
the ideas for the adventures of Doctor Syntax were struck out at a sitting and in
the easy fashion he has described; it is known that the original designs were
furnished at the rate of three a month, and that their invention was spread over
the entire period of the publication.</p>

<p>The popularity enjoyed by this Tour was manifested in the number of editions
sold; it was further pirated and imitated in various forms. A German edition was
published in Berlin in 1822; the poem was translated under the title of <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Reise
des Doktor Syntax um das Malerische aufzusuchen. Ein Gedicht frei aus dem
Englischen ins Deutsche &uuml;bertragen. Lithogr. v. F. E. Rademacher.</cite> The illustrations
were copied in outline on stone, either with a fine point or a pen; the
lines are wire-like and give neither fullness nor effect; the pictures are also
coloured in a feeble and powerless style, and the whole is a very poor rendering,
as far as the artist's work is concerned.</p>

<p>A French edition, freely translated by M. Gandais, appeared in Paris, with
twenty-six engravings&mdash;rendered with considerable ability by Malapeau (lith. de
G. Engelmann)&mdash;drawn on stone with care and spirit in lithographic chalk; these
illustrations, printed in a warm tint, and coloured by hand, will compare fairly
with even Rowlandson's original etchings. We give the title of this edition:&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le
Don Quichotte Romantique, ou Voyage du Docteur Syntaxe &agrave; la recherche du
Pittoresque et du Romantique; Po&ecirc;me en XX chants, traduit librement de
l'Anglais par M. Gandais, et orn&eacute; de 26 gravures par Malapeau. &Agrave; Paris
chez l'auteur, rue du Faubourg Saint Denis 45, et P&eacute;licier libraire, cour du Palais
Royal.</i> 1821. The author's advertisement, as written by Combe, is carefully
and literally rendered, and the translator has added a slight <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avertissement</i> of his
own, briefly alluding to the reputation enjoyed in England by the original engravings
and the descriptive verses which accompany them, and setting forth the circumstances
of his own version, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Numerous imitations, less legitimate than the foreign translations alluded to,
also appeared in this country, such as <cite>The Tour of Doctor Syntax through
London</cite>; <cite>Doctor Syntax in Paris, in Search of the Grotesque</cite>; <cite>Doctor Prosody</cite>;
<cite>Sentimental Tour through Margate and Hastings by Doctor Comparative, Junr.</cite>;
and <cite>Doctor Syntax's Life of Napoleon</cite>, which is possibly due to Combe's pen,
and derives a strong additional interest from the illustrations, which are fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_250" id="Page_ii_250">[250]</a></span>
examples of George Cruikshank's handiwork. A parody, in verse, entitled <cite>The
Adventures of Doctor Comicus, by a modern Syntax</cite>, was also issued, with
coloured imitations of Rowlandson's designs.</p>

<p>The success which had attended the first <cite>Tour of Doctor Syntax</cite> was so
flattering and remunerative that the publisher and his able collaborateurs, the
artist and author, projected a second series, entitled <cite>Doctor Syntax in Search of
Consolation</cite>&mdash;for the loss of that termagant spouse who figures in the original <em>Tour</em>,
and is decently buried, in the first cantos of the new adventures, to give the hero
a fitting cause for pursuing his eccentric travels. The renewal of Dr. Syntax's
journeys, which appeared in monthly parts, was completed in 1820, when it was
republished by Mr. Ackermann, uniform with the first volume; it was less successful
than its predecessor, but it ran through several editions.</p>

<p>The plates, which were contributed by Rowlandson, much on his old principle,
were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>A third and final Tour, ending with the hero's funeral, concludes the poem.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_251" id="Page_ii_251">[251]</a></span>
The last volume, which had appeared, like its predecessors, in monthly parts, was
put forth in its collected form in 1821; and, similar to the first and second series,
with which it was afterwards re-issued, it received sufficient patronage to carry it
through several editions, although neither the Second nor Third Tours were
reckoned so successful as the original series.</p>

<p>The <cite>Third Tour of Doctor Syntax&mdash;in Search of a Wife</cite> appeared with the
following 'Preface,' from the pen of the veteran Combe, who, for his private
reasons, preferred to continue anonymous throughout.</p>

<p>'This prolonged work is, at length, brought to a close. It has grown to this
size under rare and continuing marks of public favour; while the same mode of
composition has been employed in the last as in the former volumes. They are
all equally indebted to Mr. Rowlandson's talents.</p>

<p>'It may, perhaps, be considered as presumptuous in me, and at my age, to
sport even with my own dowdy Muse, but, from the extensive patronage which
Doctor Syntax has received, it may be presumed that, more or less, he has continued
to amuse: And I, surely, have no reason to be dissatisfied, when Time
points at my eightieth year, that I can still afford some pleasure to those who are
disposed to be pleased.</p>

<p>The popularity which attended the three Tours in the form of their original
publication induced Mr. Ackermann to issue a fresh edition in 1823. The
three volumes were printed in 16mo, instead of royal 8vo, and the plates were
re-engraved, one-third of the original size. This pocket edition, containing all
the illustrations, in a reduced form, was published at the moderate price, considering
the plates were coloured by hand, of seven shillings a volume; the
former series having been produced at one guinea per volume.</p>

Published by T. Tegg (210).&mdash;A physician has been called in, and, with his gold
stick in hand, is examining the condition of certain patients who are suffering
from the effects of too indiscriminate feeding. A gouty old gentleman, his wife,
and their footman are all putting out their tongues&mdash;which are white and swollen
to an inordinate length; their features express the greatest alarm, and the look
of consternation which is thrown into the doctor's face conveys the reverse of

of his race. A couple of Jewesses, whose persons are resplendent in
jewellery, are leaning over the wicket-gate of their premises, lost in admiration

Shevi&mdash;a sufficiently motherly-looking lady&mdash;to salute with a kiss. Another

horrified contortions and his hair standing on end at making the discovery of this
incredible depravity.</p>

<p>The secret of how the interdicted quadrupeds have come into the possession

exhibited at Ackermann's Repository of Arts during the Illuminations
of the 5th and 6th November, 1813, in honour of the splendid
victories obtained by the Allies over the armies of France, at Leipzic and its
environs.</cite>&mdash;'This subject, representing the two tyrants&mdash;viz., the tyrant Buonaparte
and the tyrant Death&mdash;sitting together on the field of battle, in a

is very entertaining. It is also instructive to observe that the former is now
placed in a situation in which all Europe <em>may see through him</em>. The emblem,
too, of the circle of dazzling light from mere <em>vapour</em>, which is so <em>soon extinguished</em>,
has a good moral effect; and as the gas represents the dying flame, so does the
drum, on which he is seated, typify the hollow and noisy nature of the falling
usurper.'</p>

<p>The above description of the subject appeared in the <cite>Sun</cite> of Saturday,
November 6, 1813. These printed comments arose from the picture itself
having been transparent, and from a circle which surmounted the same, indicative
of the strength and brotherly union of the Allies, composed of gas of
brilliant brightness. (See January 1, 1814.)</p>

<p><i>November 22, 1813.</i> <cite>The Norwich Bull Feast, or Glory and Gluttony.</cite>
Published by T. Tegg (232).&mdash;The success gained by the allied armies over
Napoleon and his forces, and the series of French disasters which had culminated at
Leipzig, gave rise to rejoicings all over the country, in celebration of the supposed
final downfall of the Corsican Emperor, the traditional enemy of England, as the
people had been taught to consider him. Norwich, according to the print, is the
scene of disorderly revelry. A huge bullock has been roasted whole in the market-place,
and the carcase is being cut up and distributed in the streets; the unruly
mob fighting over the morsels and wrenching the bones from those who are
ravenously picking them; scuffles, struggles, scrimmages, and savage onslaughts
are the order of the day. At the same time a puncheon of beer or spirits is
broached for gratuitous distribution, and a pretty spectacle of misrule is the
consequence. The fair sex are represented as the chief competitors for the drink;
pails, cans, and jugs are eagerly filled, and as greedily emptied; the contents
being poured down the throats of the holders or down those of their friends, who
are opening their mouths to receive the liquor, which is gushing forth in streams.
The incidents surrounding the liquor-cart are, if possible, more disreputable and
degrading than those transpiring on all sides of the trestles on which the ox is
being dismembered by a pair of butcher's men, armed with a chopper and a huge
carver. Some of the female patriots are reduced to insensibility, and efforts are
being made to revive one poor creature, who is lying unconscious in the midst
of the struggling mass, either overpowered by the potency of the drink or
smothered by the pressure; buckets of the fluid are being emptied over the
prostrate sufferer by tipsy Samaritans, without alleviating her condition.</p>

<p>The town of Norwich is given up to the gala; flags are flying, and illuminations
and fireworks render the sight more animated. A tumultuous procession
is struggling along, bearing guns, pikes, &amp;c., and carrying the effigy of Buonaparte
to be gibbeted or burnt at a bonfire. Flags head the mob, inscribed
<em>Downfall of the Tyrant</em>; <a href="#PEACE"><em>Peace and Plenty</em></a>, &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p><i>November 25, 1813.</i> <a href="#LONG_PULL"><cite>A Long Pull, a Strong Pull, and a Pull All together.</cite></a>
Published by T. Tegg (233).&mdash;The end of 1813 promised to witness the downfall
of the great 'little Boney;' one misfortune followed another; ally after ally abandoned
the conqueror, who in the hour of victory had behaved magnanimously to
the subjugated States, and they in return deserted their new friend when disasters
were pressing on him&mdash;a sure proof of the danger of confiding in alliances extracted
at the point of the sword or made in bad faith on grounds of desperate expediency.
As we have seen, the blow came from the North: the treachery of Bernadotte,
King of Sweden, a man who owed his elevation to the Emperor, pointed the way
to prostrate Europe to free herself from the ambitious thraldom of Napoleon;
the Russian Bear broke his false slumbers, the Austrian and Prussian Eagles
escaped from their chains, Spain was cleared of the invaders, and lastly the Kingdom
of Holland revolted in the rear of the disabled Corsican. The king, Napoleon's
brother, Louis, whom he had imposed on this kingdom, had voluntarily
abdicated the crown in favour of his son, a minor, in 1810. The subject is treated
allegorically by Rowlandson. <em>The Sun of Tyranny</em> is setting on the deep; the
fleets of the allies are riding on the seas, which are once more free, and the
Dutch are helping to push off the Texel fleet to join the common cause. As
the Allies marched against France after Napoleon's defeat at Leipzig, a combined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_259" id="Page_ii_259">[259]</a></span>
force was sent against Holland, which had been incorporated with the French
Empire in 1810, and placed under the constitution of Jan. 1, 1811, the seventeen
provinces of the Netherlands being united under the dominion of France. The
Prussian and Russian forces, under General B&uuml;low, were joined by a detachment
from England under General Graham; the old Orange party once more came
into activity, and on November 30, 1813, the hereditary Stadtholder arrived at
the Hague. The caricaturist has simplified his view of the situation by ignoring
the change of affairs that had intervened since 1810, when the Duke of Piacenza
became the Emperor's representative in Amsterdam until 1811, when the State
was merged into the French Empire. The artist has assumed that the kingdom
had remained as administered at the resignation of Louis, July 1, 1810; and
accordingly the abdicated monarch, without his crown, is pictured dancing about
in a distracted state on the soil of Holland, deploring: 'Oh! Brother Nap,
Brother Nap, we shan't be left with half a crown a-piece!' Napoleon is represented,
according to the usual fashion of the satirists, flying about in an ungovernable
frenzy as he views the receding fleet and recognises the revolt of
the Netherlanders: 'Oh! Brother Joe, I'm all fire; my passion eats me up!
Such unlooked-for storms of ills fall on me! It beats down all my cunning; I
cannot bear it! My ears are filled with noise, my eyes grow dim, and feeble
shakings seize every limb!'</p>

<p>The <cite>Long Pull, Strong Pull, and a Pull all together</cite> is taking place on the
mainland. The weight and persevering force of John Bull is telling on the
towing-line; the Don Spaniard is hand-over-hand with the national prototype,
a condition of things marvellously altered since the days of the caricature. A
Russian, in furs, is the next in energy; an Austrian huzzar has the rope well over
his shoulder; a Prussian and others are throwing their exertions into the haul;
and all is moving as merrily as could be desired.</p>

<p><i>November 27, 1813.</i> <cite>The Corsican Toad under a Harrow.</cite> Published by R.
Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;The Corsican, who is represented as both prematurely
aged and haggard, is sprawled, spread-eaglewise, on the ground; upon him is a
formidable harrow, which is kept in its place by the obese figure of a traditional
Hollander, who is leisurely smoking, with his hands in his pockets and an Orange
favour in his hat, in philosophic indifference to the situation and sufferings of the
victim, who is exclaiming, 'Oh! this heavy Dutchman! Oh! had I not enough to
bear before!!!'</p>

<p>A Cossack is goading on the prostrate leader of the French with his lance;
and a bird of prey is swooping down, attracted by the smell of carrion. The
harrow is in vigorous hands, representatives of Austria, Prussia, and other
German Powers; Spaniards, Portuguese, and a British tar are tugging away
with hearty good-will.</p>

by a rope round his neck to a gallows, and facing him, on another gallows, is
the figure of the Emperor Napoleon, in his uniform as general of the French
army. A bonfire is blazing up bravely, and a party of schoolboys and villagers
are the delighted spectators. A note informs us that the scene is not an imaginary
one, but is a faithful representation of a 'bonfire at Thorpe Hall, near Louth,
Lincolnshire, on 5th November, 1813, given by the Rev. W. <span class="locked">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> to the boys
belonging to the seminary at Louth, in consequence of the arrival of news of

<p class="small">I, Napoleon Buonaparte, flattered by all the French

world and the scorn and sport of boys. Had I not spurned
the firm wisdom of the Right Hon. William Pitt, I might

<p><i>November 29, 1813.</i> <cite>Dutch Nightmare, or the Fraternal Hug Returned
with a Dutch Squeeze.</cite> Published by R. Ackermann.&mdash;The great Emperor is
stretched, sleepless, on his imperial state bed, with the diadem above and a row
of captive crowns embroidered round the canopy, the fasces of Roman lictors at
the feet, and the furniture powdered with golden eagles and fleur-de-lis. This
luxurious couch is not to be coveted, since tranquil rest is out of the question.
The Emperor is writhing in agony, saddled with a nightmare which is not to be
dislodged. The Hollanders at this time contrived to shake themselves free from
their fraternal friends the French, who had laid their country under contributions
until the disciples of freedom prayed to be delivered from their tutors. The
example of Holland and the victories ending with the triumph at Leipzig gained
by the Allies, and especially the successes secured under Wellington, re-encouraged
the subjugated and prostrate Powers to look forward to the recovery of their
freedom, and to take their revenge on the little conqueror. A stout Dutchman,
dressed in his national costume, and wearing the Orange cockade, is, according
to the picture, returning the lesson in fraternity which had cost him dear at
the hands of the French, by showing his instructor the vigour of a hearty Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_261" id="Page_ii_261">[261]</a></span>
squeeze. This heavy incubus, with his hands in his pockets, is smoking his pipe,
and puffing the distasteful fumes full into the face of the powerless and disgusted
Corsican, and crying, 'Orange Boven!'</p>

<p><i>November 30, 1813.</i> <cite>Plump to the Devil we boldly Kicked both Nap and his
Partner Joe.</cite> Published by T. Tegg (234).&mdash;The heavy Hollander, still sporting
his Orange colours, is finally roused to dispose of the intruders by the most
summary and quickest method possible; with his pipe in one hand and a squab
bottle of Schiedam, or Dutch courage, held like a mallet in the other, Mynheer
is giving Nap a taste of Dutch weight; one vigorous kick has propelled the
little Corsican high into the air and plump into the arms of the Father of Evil,
who is emerging from his 'Brimstone Lake' to make sure of his friend. In the
distance another Dutchman, provided with a pitchfork, is prodding Napoleon's
brother Louis&mdash;who had been created King of Holland&mdash;towards the same refuge
for the destitute; the usurper's crown being left behind in the flight.</p>

<p><i>December 4, 1813.</i> <cite>The Corsican Munchausen&mdash;humming the Lads of Paris.</cite>
Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;The Emperor, with all the bombast,
bravado, and speciousness of which he had an excellent command, has summoned
a meeting of his faithful subjects and supporters&mdash;who, judging from the expression
of their faces, appear but an unwilling and disaffected audience&mdash;in order to present
his infant son to the people. The scion of the great captain is dressed in a miniature
uniform, with a long sabre trailing on the ground, and a gold stick, which he is
trying to fancy is a riding-horse. The Imperial throne, the back of which bears
a Medusa's head and a globe of the world, is capsized by Munchausen's man&oelig;uvrings.
The Corsican is vapouring on a grand scale, trying ineffectually to
raise the ardour of his dupes: 'Did I not swear I would destroy Austria? Did I
not swear I would destroy Prussia? Did I not leave the Russians 1,200 pieces of
cannon to build a monument of the victory of Moscow? Did I not lead 498,000
men to gather fresh laurels in Russia? Did I not burn Moscow, and leave
400,000 brave soldiers to perish in the snow, for the good of the French nation?
Did I not swear I would destroy Sweden? Did I not swear I would have
colonies and commerce? Did I not build more ships than you could find sailors
for? Did I not burn all the British produce, bought and paid for by my faithful
merchants, before their faces, for the good of them and of my good people of
Paris? Have I not called my troops from Holland, that they might not winter
in that foggy climate? Have I not called my troops from Spain and Portugal, to
the ruin of the English? Did I not change my religion and turn Turk, for the
good of the French nation? Have I not blown up the corporal for blowing up
the bridge? Have I not robbed the churches of twenty flags to send to my
Empress, for the loss of my own flags and eagles? And now, for the good of my
Empire, behold, O ye Lads of Paris! I have put the King of Rome in breeches!!!'</p>

<p><i>December 6, 1813.</i> <cite>Funking the Corsican.</cite> Published by R. Ackermann.&mdash;The
situation of the Emperor, as pictured by Rowlandson, is becoming critical;
he is elevated on a cask of 'real Hollands Geneva,' on the top of which he is
dancing about in exasperation, unable to assist himself, and surrounded by his
enemies, who are all putting the great conqueror to his wits' end and revenging
themselves by smoking out the Corsican; each of the representatives of the
rebellious States and Powers being armed with a pipe, and pouring volumes of the
fumes round the person of the tortured general; Spain, Portugal, Hanover; the
Cossack, the Pole, Austria, Sweden, Bavaria, and Prussia, seated on a cannon,
are all assisting; the King of W&uuml;rtemburg is provided with a flask of 'W&uuml;rtemburg
drops;' John Bull has his foaming jug of 'brown stout;' while the Dutch
Mynheer, seated on a cask of Dutch herrings, with his tobacco-pouch and twists
of pigtail, is drawing a flagon of Geneva to drink success to his Serene Highness,
sending out a volume of tobacco-fumes, which are completing the irritation of the
badgered Corsican, who is kicking off the head of the Hollands cask, into which
he will evidently plump head over <span class="locked">ears&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The fly that sips treacle is lost in the sweets.
</p>

<p>Before disappearing condign vengeance is threatened on the heads of his
enemies: 'Oh! you base traitors and deserters! Eleven hundred thousand
Lads of Paris shall roast every one of you alive, as soon as they can catch
you!'</p>

<p><i>December 10, 1813.</i> <cite>The Mock Ph&oelig;nix!!! or a vain attempt to rise again.</cite>
Published by R. Ackermann.&mdash;Holland, in the person of a Dutch skipper, and
Russia, in that of a Cossack, are blowing and stirring a fire which is to consume
the Corsican. Flames are issuing from the furnace, and, in spite of the exertions
of the stokers, the figure of the Emperor is seen dwarfed, but still intact, in the
thick of the fire, but whether he will rise seems doubtful; his diadem is in full
blaze, while the orb and sceptre are snatched away by certain diabolic claws, and
the ph&oelig;nix process threatens to prove a signal failure. Serpents are crawling
out of the mouth of the furnace; showers of snakes, dragons, devils, and all kinds
of monsters, kin of the ph&oelig;nix, are hovering amidst the smoke, and making
hostile demonstrations against the declining conqueror.</p>

<p><i>December 12, 1813.</i> <cite>Friends and Foes&mdash;up he Goes&mdash;Sending the Corsican
Munchausen to St. Cloud.</cite> Published by R. Ackermann.&mdash;The Emperor is left,
unsupported, in the hands of his enemies, now turned into tormentors: he is
thrown into a blanket and tossed up into the air, and is suffering worse discomforts
than did Sancho Panza under a similar infliction; crown, sceptre, and
sword are shaken off. '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">O misericorde!</i>' cries the flying Munchausen as he is sent
up to the clouds. John Bull (whose wig and hat have been thrown aside), the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_263" id="Page_ii_263">[263]</a></span>
Dutch Mynheer, and Spanish Don are performing wonders with their side of the
blanket; then come the Cossack, the Pope, the Pole, the Prince Imperial of
Austria, the Emperors of Russia and Austria, and the Kings of Prussia, Hanover,
and W&uuml;rtemburg, who are all lending a hand to torment the Corsican.</p>

<p><i>December 14, 1813.</i> <cite>Political Chemists and German Retorts, or Dissolving the
Rhenish Confederacy.</cite> Published by R. Ackermann.&mdash;A delicate operation, which
has engaged the attention of all the leading Powers of Europe, is supposed to be
proceeding. The colossal power of the Corsican is undergoing transmutation,
and the conqueror is gradually being resolved into his original elements. A
<em>German Stove</em> supplies the furnace, and the fuel is recruited from John Bull's
<em>Coal Tub</em>; that patriotic person is assisting the process as one of the leading
experimental chemists; <em>Dutch bellows</em> are furnishing various powerful blasts;
the <em>Spanish Don</em> is pounding some effectually irresistible chemicals in his famous
mortar, <em>Saragossa</em>. The Corsican has been forced into a receiver; Bernadotte
is pouring in a portion of <em>sulphate of Swedish iron</em> before the cover is fixed on;
the Emperor, who has been reduced to mere pigmy proportions, is praying for
time: 'Oh, spare me till the King of Rome is ripe for mischief yet to come!'
In various retorts are seen the several elements which entered into the Imperial
analysis, now resolved apart&mdash;<em>Intrigue and Villany</em>, <em>Ambition and Folly</em>,
<em>Gasconade and Lies</em>, <em>Arrogance and Atrocity</em>, <em>Fire and Sword</em>, <em>Murder and
Plunder</em>. All the leading States of Europe are engaged in the operation; the
King of W&uuml;rtemburg is giving his instructions; Prussia, Austria, Hesse, &amp;c., are
all interested in the success of the operation. The Pope has contributed two
potent agents, <em>Fulminating powder</em>, and <em>Drops from the vial of wrath</em>.
Russia, Poland, the Emperor of Austria, &amp;c., are seated, as chemists, at a table
dividing out the agents selected to dissolve the structure raised by Napoleon.
From certain tracts at the Cossack's feet we learn that the 'liberty of Germany'
and the 'downfall of Boney' are settled projects; while the name of Napoleon,
as protector of the Rhenish confederacy, is crossed out, and that of 'Francis,
Emperor of Austria, restored 1813,' is substituted in its old ascendency.</p>

<p>The head of Napoleon appears as the centre of the constellation, <em>Polar Star</em>,
elevated, in this case, like that of a traitor, on a pole, and surrounded by entwined
and hissing serpents. Above is the face of Satan, wearing a crown of <em>Damnation</em>,
supported by two escutcheons, marked <em>Heart of Tyrant</em>, and <em>Vulture</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_264" id="Page_ii_264">[264]</a></span>
with scourges and pronged forks. The pole is elevated on the great globe; in
either corner is a French eagle; above the Imperial ensigns are pikes, axes, and
standards, 'flags manufactured for the Empress,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>The lustre of the constellation, Napoleon, is likely to suffer an eclipse from
the sudden descent of a Dutch comet&mdash;a philosophic Hollander, seated astride
on a barrel of Hollands Schiedam, the contents of which he is ignominiously
discharging over the head of the solitary star of the firmament. The golden rays
with which the <em>astre brillant</em> is illuminating the universe owe their source to the
following luminous achievements:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="list">
<li>Assisting in the assassination of Louis the Sixteenth, my Benefactor.</li>
<li>Murdering the citizens of Paris under Robespierre.</li>
<li>Murdering the citizens of Toulon.</li>

<li>Poisoning my own sick soldiers at the hospital at Jaffa.</li>

<li>Murdering Captain Wright in the Temple, at Paris.</li>
<li>Marrying two wives and intriguing with the daughter of one of them.</li>
<li>The murder of Palm, of Hofer, &amp;c., &amp;c.</li>
<li>Leading 500,000 Frenchmen to perish in Russia by the severity of the season 1812.</li>
<li>Losing another similar army the following year in Germany, 1813.</li>
<li>Writing lying bulletins.</li>
<li>Losing all the colonies, commerce, and shipping.</li>

</ul>

<p><i>December 25, 1813.</i> <cite>Mock Auction, or Boney Selling Stolen Goods.</cite> Published
by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;Napoleon is pictured, before his reverses became
of a decided character, contemplating realising the conquests he had in hand,
with a possible view of retiring from the trade. The Emperor has a sale-pulpit,
and is himself officiating as auctioneer; the lot which is being offered is the
crown of Spain; an old general is holding up the diadem, and the auctioneer,
impatient at the indifference of the purchasers, is crying, 'What! no bidding for
the crown of Spain? Then take the other crowns and lump them into one lot'&mdash;referring
to a pile of diadems, the crowns of Russia, Austria, Prussia, the Papal
tiara, &amp;c., thrown into a corner, with bundles of standards, 'lots of useless
eagles,' &amp;c. Lot 2, 'Twenty flags, the property of the Empress,' 'Kingdom of
Prussia,' 'Kingdom of Westphalia,' 'Saxony,' 'United Provinces,' &amp;c. The
Empress is standing behind her husband, with the infant prince in her arms.
Napoleon's heir is dressed in a uniform like his father's; his face is that of a
monkey. 'I suppose daddy will put us up for sale?' he is represented as saying
to the Empress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_265" id="Page_ii_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mock Auction has drawn plenty of company together. The Dutchman is
smoking his pipe with his accustomed philosophy; a British tar is patting him
on the back, as his very cordial ally, and ridiculing the Corsican's failure. The
King of W&uuml;rtemburg, Russia pictured as a Cossack, Austria as a huzzar, Prussia,
Bavaria, and other Powers are present. The Spanish Don is making light of
Buonaparte's pretence of offering his crown for sale; 'That a crown!' he is
shouting. 'It's not worth half a crown!'</p>

Crane for the Accommodation of Rheumatic Rectors.</cite> Rowlandson delin. and publisher.&mdash;The
incident depicted is taking place at the door of the rectory, beside
the church porch, where a crane has been erected for the accommodation of the
gouty and unwieldy divine. Two frisky and solidly-built damsels are hauling
away at a rope, to which a sling is attached. The corpulent rector is swinging
in mid air, preparatory to being lowered into the saddle; in his pocket is shown a
discourse on the apposite text&mdash;'<em>He that humbleth himself shall be exalted</em>.' A
grinning groom is holding the head of a high-cruppered horse; the minister's
steed is a curiously constructed instance of equine anatomy, fondly reviving the
image of the faithful <em>Grizzle</em>, rendered memorable as the <em>Rosinante</em> of Doctor
Syntax, the long-enduring companion of his famous <cite>Tour in Search of the
Picturesque</cite>.</p>

red cloaks, and steeple-crowned hats, are seated at a cauldron, working incantations,
to assist at which serpents, hobgoblins, and various weird monsters are conjured
up. A rustic clown, with a lantern and hayfork, who has thrown back the
trapdoor, and is ascending to the hayloft for some purpose, is paralysed with
horror and affright at the unholy spectacle suddenly revealed to his sight.</p>

the members of a board, seated at the green baize, are cross-questioning a
Quaker, represented in a suit of conventional sad-coloured apparel, and wearing
the typical broad-brimmed hat. The humility of the sectarian has proved too
deep for the inquisitors, whose exactions he is evading. The chairman is indignantly
remarking, 'What an impertinent fellow to keep on his hat before such
a dignified assembly!' Cries one of the examiners, 'None of your <em>thees</em> and
<em>thous</em> here, sir&mdash;come to the point&mdash;we know you have evaded certain duties.'
'Pray, sir, do you know what we sit here for?' pertinently demands another
commissioner; to which the Quaker, with clasped hands, and rocking himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_266" id="Page_ii_266">[266]</a></span>
like <em>Mawworm</em>, on his toes, responds, 'Verily I do&mdash;some sit here for five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_267" id="Page_ii_267">[267]</a></span>
hundred, others for a thousand; and moreover I have heard it reported that
some sit here for two thousand pounds per annum!'</p>

blisters' at his side, since the ranges of physic-bottles which ornament his apartment
have, to all appearance, finished the patient's business effectually; he is
visited by a corpulent self-satisfied practitioner, whose hat is under one arm and
his cane under the other; the doctor is addressing his unconscious patient: 'My

and powdered doctor, in whose pocket appears a dose labelled <em>Final</em>. An
undertaker, in professional weeds, is coming in at the door, with his crape-bound
mute's wand in his hand, and a coffin strapped on his shoulder. The ghostly
personification of Death, as a skeleton, holding up his hour-glass, is pointing his
dart through the latticed window. Below the chair of the smug slumbering
practitioner appears a paper bearing the well-known lines:&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="d1814" id="d1814"></a>1814.</h2>


<p><i>January 1, 1814.</i> <cite>The Double Humbug, or the Devil's Imp Praying for Peace.</cite>
Published by R. Ackermann.&mdash;In two compartments: <em>Napoleon before his Slaves</em>,
and <em>Napoleon before his Conquerors</em>. The first view represents the Senate; the
Emperor is standing on his throne, which is propped upon the crowns of conquered
kingdoms; his dark friend, the Devil, is leaning over the back of the Imperial
chair and prompting the specious harangue which Napoleon is addressing to the
senators, who do not seem to be much interested in the proclamation, and, on the
whole, according to the artist's showing, look very like a body of imbeciles. <em>Extracts
from Buonaparte's Speech. Sunday, December 19, 1813.</em>&mdash;'Senators, Councillors
of State, Deputies from the Departments to the Legislative Body,&mdash;Splendid
victories have raised the glory of the French arms during this campaign. In
these weighty circumstances it was my first thought to call you all around me.
I have never been seduced by prosperity; I have conceived and executed great
designs for the prosperity and the happiness of the world. As a monarch and a
father, I feel that peace adds to the security of thrones and that of families. I
have accepted proposals and the preliminaries. It is necessary to recruit my
armies by numerous levies, and an increase of taxes becomes indispensable. I
am satisfied with the sentiments of my people of Italy, Denmark, Naples, America,
and the nineteen Swiss Cantons, and have acknowledged the laws which England
has in vain sought, during four centuries, to impose on France. I have ordered
discharges of artillery on my coming and leaving you.'</p>

<p>The other side of the picture displays the fallen Emperor under an entirely
opposite aspect; this time he has to confront his enemies, and a totally changed
demeanour is adopted. The Corsican is on his knees; before him is his sword, a
pile of standards, and the diadems he had abstracted from numerous crowned
heads; the crown of France he has tucked under his arm; all the rest he is
offering to restore to his enemies, the rightful owners, who have mustered in force
and are completely masters of the situation. The attitudes of the Allies are expressive
of their indignation at 'Boney's' shameful avowals; while Talleyrand, on
his lame leg, in the greatest trepidation at the dangers which face him, is offering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_272" id="Page_ii_272">[272]</a></span>
to swear to the truth of the damaging admissions which his master has found it
expedient to make, since falsehood will not serve him in this quarter.</p>

<p>'Gentlemen, Emperors, Rhenish Confederations, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.,&mdash;Behold before
you a fallen impostor, who has for many years been drunk and intoxicated with
ambition, arrogance, and insolence; who has deceived, cheated, and tricked you on
many occasions; who has foolishly and wickedly lost, within a twelvemonth, a
million of brave but deluded Frenchmen; who has conceived the great and
diabolical design of enslaving the world, and has lost all his friends except Yankee
Maddison. Now, gentlemen, to make amends for my sins, I solicit your pardon
and ask for peace on your own terms, gentlemen, and I will strictly adhere to it
till.... You may take all those crowns back again, except the one belonging
to the Bourbons. My Empress sends you also back the twenty flags I found in
some of the churches, in the course of my flight from Leipzig. As for the story,
gentlemen, of the corporal and the blowing up of the bridge, you must know
'twas mere humbug to gull the lads of Paris.'</p>

<p><i>January 1, 1814.</i> <cite>Death and Buonaparte.</cite> Published at Ackermann's Repository.&mdash;The
Corsican, who had faced and conquered Fate on so many fields
of battle, is at length confronted with the grim foe under circumstances which
lend additional terrors to his proximity. The reverses which overtook the conqueror
at Leipzig are already threatening the downfall of that intrepid will and
shaking a self-possession hitherto imperturbable.</p>

<p>Rowlandson has taken advantage of the thickening disasters, which had then
commenced to check the prowess of the Emperor's armies, to represent the
Corsican in a fit of despondency, forlorn and abstracted, seated on a drum in an
attitude of dejection, with his head between his hands, staring in the face of the
King of Terrors, of whose close company he is seemingly too self-occupied to
take much heed. The grim destroyer, as the skeleton Death, is watching the
baffled general face to face, assuming a parody of his attitude, and seated on a
gun, with a broken eagle standard at his bony feet. The Russian, Austrian,
Prussian, Bavarian, and other allied armies are streaming along in unbroken
hosts, scattering the dismayed legions of France, and making havoc amidst the
ranks of the discouraged Grand Army, which is melting away before the combined
forces.</p>

familiar habit by which his figure is best recognised, the little cocked hat, the
green coat, buttoned across the chest, the white waistcoat and breeches, is tearing
his hardest towards 'Maynz' and the Rhine; a frightened hare, suggestive of the
Imperial courage, is scampering before him and marking the way. The 'little
Corporal' carries, instead of a walking-stick, the effigy of the great Emperor of
Germany, <em>Carolus Magnus</em>, at the head of a pole. On his back is a pack, from
which the various collections he had previously gathered are suffered to escape:

Dark Fiend in person, drawn on a tremendous scale, with his claws, horns, hoofs,
tail, and terror-striking accessories, is seated on his sulphurous floor, cradling and
dandling his pet progeny, '<em>Little Boney</em>;' the figure of the Corsican is wrapped
up like a mummy in swaddling-clothes, bound round with tricolor ribands; the
face is alone exposed; and his Infernal Majesty is contemplating the calm,
thoughtful, wax mask-like countenance of his reputed vicegerent on earth with
earnest attention; his own features are wearing an expression which is at least
threatening; the Legion of Honour, instituted by the Emperor, is held out by the
apocryphal fiend as a bauble to tempt the spoiled child in his lap.</p>

<p><i>April 9, 1814.</i> <cite>Blucher the Brave extracting the Groan of Abdication from
the Corsican Bloodhound.</cite> Published by T. Tegg (322).&mdash;The Corsican has
been run down; the sturdy figure of the indomitable General Blucher is shown
acting as his executioner. Having come up with the enemy and beaten him, the
general is shaking the bloodhound out of his trappings; sword, diadem, and
habit are cast aside, and the creature is swinging in the Prussian's iron grasp,
a mere frightened cur, with nothing of the dreaded 'Boney' left but his head.
A boat is on the shore, and the fugitive, <em>Brother Joe</em>, the rejected 'intrusive
King' of Spain, in mortal terror is running his hardest to embark for the Island of
Elba; the boatman is loading in the future provision, &pound;20,000 a year, the income
decreed the Corsican for his new state. Besides the deportation of the Buonapartes
another scene is transpiring: Louis the Eighteenth, a portly and good-natured-looking
sovereign, is received with acclamations from all sides, while his
friends the Allies discreetly remain in the rear; the white flag of the Bourbons,
with its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleur de lis</i>, is waving over the restored descendant of St. Louis; the
monarch's legitimate crown is restored, and the figure of Peace personified is
adding a laurel wreath; Churchmen and some of 'Nap's' old servants are offering
their homage, and the wily Talleyrand has apparently 'ratted' judiciously at the
critical moment, as the change of masters has not displaced the veteran diplomatist,
and he is waiting on the King with a new 'list of ministers for your
Majesty's approval.'</p>

Last.</cite> Published by R. Ackermann.&mdash;Neither the subject nor its title are
altogether original, as, some six years previously, Rowlandson's contemporary,
James Gillray, had chosen to illustrate the reverses which had attended the French
arms in Spain by a similar cartoon, in which George the Third appeared as
the huntsman, holding out the carcass of the Corsican fox. Both conceptions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_279" id="Page_ii_279">[279]</a></span>
in these instances, as subsequent events proved, were somewhat premature as
far as the conclusiveness of the performance was concerned.</p>

<p>Prince Blucher, the valiant old trooper, has taken the lead of the field; he has
dismounted from his horse, whose bridle he is holding in his left hand, while his
right is locked round the throat of the Fox, who is struggling and clawing vainly
to get free; 'Boney's' face is turning the pallid hue of deadly fear in sight of the
eager pack of hounds, which are showing their teeth and leaping forward to rend
the vermin to fragments; the dogs are of good strain; on their collars may be
read the names of those generals who finally outwitted the Corsican&mdash;Wellington,
Swartzenberg, Kutusoff, Platoff, Crown Prince, York, &amp;c., &amp;c. The allied Emperors
and Kings are riding down to be 'in at the death,' and in the distance are
seen burning towns, which have been recently devastated by the ravages of the
Corsican in his career of ambition.</p>

reduced from his state; he is meanly travelling Elbawards, and has reached the
seashore, whence he is to embark for his island residence. A gibbet by the way,
with a rope in readiness, is serving as a fingerpost to point the road; vultures,
which fly round this suggestive object, express a desire to pick the bones of the retiring
'carcass butcher.' All the splendours of 'Boney's' surroundings are stripped
bare; he is riding on a rough-coated donkey, and wearing a 'fool's cap' in place of
a crown; his only provision is a bag of brown bread; his consort, loose and
ragged, is seated at the crupper on the same beast, which is being unmercifully
flogged with a stick labelled '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">B&acirc;ton Marc&eacute;chal</i>;' 'Boney' is lost in terror; his
juvenile heir, lately made King of Rome, is preceding the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cort&eacute;ge</i>, mounted on

<p>A French postilion, of the old school, is jumping about for joy, in his huge

<p>General Prince Blucher is leading off the two convicts; a halter is round
'Boney's' neck; he has donkey's ears, and is made to wear a fool's cap, inscribed,
'Transported for life;' his face bears a look of terror and degradation as he is
dragged forward by his merciless conductor, handcuffed to his brother Joe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_280" id="Page_ii_280">[280]</a></span>
'ex-King of the Beggars,' who is branded 'Coward and Thief.' A scorpion, 'Execration,'
is fastening on to 'Boney's' person; and another reptile, 'Detestation,'
is spitting venom at his less conspicuous relative. The exiled convicts are being
conducted past a file of Prussian Guards, and the drums are beating the 'Rogue's
March.' Their leader, Blucher, bears a long quarter-master's staff, with a proclamation
setting forth: 'Napoleon, late Emperor of the French, King of Italy, Protector
of the Confederation of the Rhine; Grand Arbiter of the Fate of Nations,
&amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., but now, by the permission of the Allied Sovereigns, exile in the Isle
of Elba, an outcast from society, a fugitive, a vagabond. Yet this is the conceited
mortal who said, "I have never been seduced by prosperity; adversity will not
be able to overcome me!"'</p>

<p>A contrast to the crestfallen Bonapartes is offered in the restored Bourbons.
A flagpole is set up, and the old royal standards are unfurled: 'Rejoice, O ye
Kings! <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive le Roi!</i>' The sovereigns of Europe once more enjoy the opportunity
of wearing their crowns in peace; and the allied monarchs are shown, in their
royal robes, with all their splendours restored, dancing hand-in-hand in a ring
round their combined escutcheons: 'Now we are met, a jolly set, in spite of
wind or weather!'</p>

<p><i>April 17, 1814.</i> <cite>The Affectionate Farewell, or Kick for Kick.</cite> Published
by R. Ackermann.&mdash;Buonaparte is being driven from France; it is clear that his
presence there, after the settlement of his abdication, was a source of embarrassment
while waiting for an opportunity to sail for his new island kingdom.
The late Imperial Chancellor is the most eager to be rid of his disgraced master;
the 'minister of expediency' is menacing the flying enemy; in one hand he holds
the deed of expatriation, 'Abdication, or the last dying speech of a murderer&mdash;who
is to be delivered into the hands of the Devil the first fair wind.' 'Tally' is
attacking his ancient confederate 'Boney' with his club-foot and his crutch simultaneously:
'<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Va t'en coquin.</i> I'll crack your crown, you pitiful vagabond;' to which
the flying exile, with his hat held in hand as a mark of respect to his new master,
is responding with humility: '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Votre tr&egrave;s humble serviteur, Monsieur Tally</i>.' A
gibbet, with its noose ready, is pointing to the 'Isle of Elba.' Seen in the distance
is the 'Boney' family, there receiving the elevation which they have merited, all
the members being collectively exalted on a gallows. The victims of 'Boney's'
successive campaigns and actions without cessation, invalids whose limbs have
been lost in his wars, are rushing up as fast as their maimed condition will permit,
flourishing their crutches and unstrapping their wooden legs, as offensive weapons
wherewith to avenge their injuries, crying: 'Bone him, my tight little Tally;'
while an invalid with one arm is waiting for the flying general at the place of
embarkation: 'What! let him sneak off without a mark or a scratch? No, no,
I'll darken his daylights for him!'</p>

<p>The events which followed Leipzig are bearing their fruit; the heads of the
Coalition have been called in, and 'Boney' is being subjected to rigorous treatment;
he is seated on a throne constructed of skeletons and skulls, wrapped
round with the Imperial purple, powdered with his emblems; but the bees
are taking flight and forsaking their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>; Field Marshal Prince Blucher is
offering the sufferer, who is sick in extremity, a huge goblet to be quaffed to

all the 'Corsican's' conquests, Portugal, Vienna, Poland, Milan, Spain, Rome,
Moscow, Holland, Switzerland, Vienna, Saxony, Florence, Dantzig, &amp;c., have
been disgorged. The figure of Father Time has winged his way to reckon with
the usurper; his hourglass is held aloft, and with a golden extinguisher Time is
about to snuff Boney out. Wellington, the Emperor Alexander of Russia, the
Emperor of Austria, and the Crown Prince are in attendance to see the last of
their troublesome enemy. France is once more freed, joyful and smiling; the
labours of agriculture are resumed, and three symbolical nymphs are executing
a joyful dance appropriate for the occasion, and supporting the arms of the
restored Bourbons.</p>

island kingdom, according to the satirist; the ship which conveyed the abdicated
monarch is riding in the bay; Boney's luggage has just been set on the shore by
a smaller craft; a single guard, one of the Mamelukes, is sitting disconsolately by
the diminished effects of his master. The somewhat squalid inhabitants, Nap's
future subjects, are crowding down the rocks with vulgar curiosity, pressing
onwards through a narrow pass leading to the shore; they seem inclined to
ridicule the deserted state of their distinguished guest, who is plunged into
dejection at his prospects.</p>

shoulders, the diadem and sceptre have fallen; the sovereignties, crowns, and
dignities which were his playthings are swept away; the once almost master of
the world is now in a desperate strait; his person is seized by the Father of Evil,
who is claiming his due; the presence of the Foul Fiend has disturbed Napoleon
less than the hand of Fate: 'Empire and victory be all forsaken to plagues,
poverty, disgrace, and shame. Strip me of all my dignities and crowns. Take
oh take your sceptres back. Spare me but life!' An arm of vengeance, appearing
from the clouds, has effectually paralysed the faculties of the conscience-smitten
conqueror; a flaming sword is hanging over his devoted head, and a
voice of terror is proclaiming retribution:&mdash;</p>

enslaved to prop his state.</p>

abandonment on the island rock which constituted his miniature kingdom of
Elba, shedding tears over 'the brief history of my life, which I intend to
publish.' This view is, like most of the deductions of satirists, rather beyond the
strict veracity of the case. Bonaparte showed himself during his stay in Elba, as
it will be remembered, both active and cheerful-minded; and it is recorded that
he would discuss with the visitors&mdash;who flocked to his miniature kingdom from
motives of curiosity&mdash;his present condition and his past state with pleasant

congress of military powers, <em>Peace</em> meaning the forces held in readiness, and
<em>Plenty</em>, in this case, referring principally to the war-chest, a plentiful supply of
artillery, powder, shell and shot, and other offensive materials. The scene is
fixed on one of the fortifications which had been set up to protect the security of
our coasts; the cliffs of 'old England' bristle with Martello towers and island<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_284" id="Page_ii_284">[284]</a></span>
defences. A drummer is sleeping tranquilly, with his arm and head resting on
his instrument, and a pile of cannon balls by his side; there are great guns of
brass and iron, with a mortar and shells, ready for use, while sentries are on the
look-out, and the soldiers are fully equipped. The British standard is flying,
and an air of gallantry is introduced by the presence of certain buxom females,
who are exciting the admiration of the soldiers of the garrison gathered around the
Dulcineas and ogling and flirting with the skittish fair, whose ample proportions
are such as to win the hearts and turn the heads of these 'sons of Mars,' released
for a while from 'war's alarms,' of which the warriors were becoming reasonably
tired after so many years of hard and comparatively profitless campaigning.</p>

whether subjects similar to the present, in which some popular nostrum was
held up to ridicule, were wholly playful or in part executed to order&mdash;a skilful
method of indirect puffing much and ingeniously practised in the magazines and
other channels of the day. The wondrous fluid Macassar is seen in application.
A stout old party has laid off his fool's cap and is seated in an armchair, undergoing
a trial of the efficacy of the oil: the perfectly bald head of the subject is
a good field for its employment, and the operator&mdash;who, by some inconsistency
characteristic of vendors of hair restoratives, is quite bereft of hair himself&mdash;is
sleepily pouring oil from a flask over the broad surface beneath him. A lady has
apparently been making a trial of the process, and on consulting the looking-glass
she seems amazed to find a bushy head of hair pushing itself straight
upwards with amazing vigour. Round the apartment are files of bottles, 'wig oil,

<p>1814. <a href="#PORTSMOUTH"><cite>Portsmouth Point.</cite></a> Published by T. Tegg (255).&mdash;The varied
humours of Portsmouth are displayed with the caricaturist's native vigour.
Nothing could be more animated than the picture, which has an air of truth,
nor could the scene be represented with fuller character, all its grotesque features
being brought forward with ready fun. The landing-place is bustling with
business; small craft of all sorts are pulling off to the ships; luggage, spirit-casks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_285" id="Page_ii_285">[285]</a></span>
and packages are being wheeled or shouldered off for debarkation. A couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_286" id="Page_ii_286">[286]</a></span>
of sailors, with hands across to form a sedan, are carrying a stout lady of fashion
down to a lighter. Jack on shore and Jack taking his chest seawards are
elbowing busy stevadores. A commander, his lady, and a porter bearing his
sea-trunk, are in the centre of the crowd; a wooden-legged fiddler is tipping a
stave for 'Poll and her partner Joe,' and a frolicsome tar is giving a parting
salute with more ardour than propriety. On one side is the respectable element&mdash;the
admirals, captains, and other naval officers, and their families, who are
parting from wife and children with a tender embrace at the door of the Ship
Tavern; and many a gallant naval hero is draining his last bowl of punch on
shore. On the opposite side such rougher contrasts are exhibited as common
sailors, lodging houses, outfitting emporiums, cast clothes marts, and ship-store
shops, <em>Moses Levy&mdash;Money Lent</em>, and similar tempting emporiums, where customers
are inspecting second-hand apparel. Such a spectacle would not be complete,
according to the taste of the times or the actualities of the case, without some
sort of uproariousness, and so we are treated to the sight of a young lady
carted off helplessly inebriated, a friendly companion supporting her shoulders,
and an honest blue-jacket bearing her legs unceremoniously slung over his
back. Another bacchanalian incident is rendered on the left, where a grinning
sailor, half-seas over, who is at least better-tempered in his cups than George
Cruikshank would have condescended to draw him in his teetotal days, is
sprawling on the road by his broken pipe and overbalancing a florid and
equally tipsy Venus, his lady-love, who is in some degree the reason of the
Jack Tar's degradation.</p>

Published by T. Tegg (341).&mdash;Rowlandson availed himself of the novel religious
fever which had its rise in the fictitious revelations of the so-called Prophetess,
Joanna Southcott, to ridicule both the believers in latter day miracles and the
members of the Establishment conjointly. One specimen of the caricatures produced
on this occasion will suffice. Joanna Southcott and one of her champions
are making a terrific charge on the flying pillars of the Episcopacy. The Bishops
are endeavouring to kick against the onslaught, and, with mitre, wig, and
crozier, are defying their chastisers; but their courage is feeble, their ranks are
breaking, and they are running off discomfited to save themselves from the
coming wrath, without taking any heed of the overthrown. The Prophetess,
wearing her famous seal round her neck, and clad in <em>Elijah's mantle</em>, is lustily
wielding a birch rod; she has caught a fugitive Archbishop by the foot, and
he is vainly struggling to escape corporal correction. The 'Third Book of
Wonders' is open at her feet. Her exertions are supported by a certain Rev.
Roger Towzer, who is chastising the disorganised heads of the Established
Church with his <em>Flail</em>; certain supernatural creatures, with flaming torches and
stings and claws, are harassing the runaways. The Prophetess is very earnest
in the work: 'Lay it on, hip and thigh, brave Towzer; smite the unbelievers.
I put no more trust in Bishops as men than I do in their chariots and horses,
but my trust is in the Lord of Hosts.' Her reverend follower is bruising away
vigorously: 'I'll well dust their woolsacks and make them drunk in my fury.
I will bring down their strength to the earth!' A strong-chest, in the rear,
is labelled <em>Contents of the Sealing; the Sealed, the Elect, to inherit the Tree of

in the present case seems to be the hunter, is brought up abruptly, in full view
of the quarry, by a river, which he has no apparent means of crossing. The
game in view, a military buck, is 'run to ground' in a summer-house, on the
opposite side of the water, where, in spite of a warning-board about <em>Man-traps</em>,
he is visibly poaching on the hunter's preserves.</p>

<p><i>January 1, 1815.</i> <cite>Female Politicians.</cite> Published by T. Tegg. Woodward
del., Rowlandson sculp.&mdash;The fair members of a well-to-do family are seated at
table. The elder is reading the news of the Corsican's last outrages: 'They
write from Hanover that when Boneyparte took possession of that country he
ravished all the women.' 'Oh, the wretch!' cries an old maid. A less antiquated
lady is giving her fair neighbour the comforting assurance, 'It's very
true, ma'am: it's only a word and a blow with him; your honour or your
property.' 'Well, ma'am,' declares a buxom creature, 'if he should come here,
at all events I'll take care of my property.' To which a budding maiden is
adding, 'So will I, mamma.'</p>

<p><i>March 1, 1815.</i> <cite>Breaking up of the Blue Stocking Club.</cite> Published by T.
Tegg (343).&mdash;The dissolution of this assembly is marked by a certain amount
of animosity and fury. The learned ladies are engaging in pairs, and the subject
under discussion is handled with more zeal than discretion, the arguments employed
being chiefly forcible. The <em>Blue Stockings</em> are sadly mauled; garments
and hair are alike torn and dishevelled. The table, the tea equipage, and the
president's armchair have all come to grief; one fair and fierce debater is trying
to impress her opponent with the kettle-stand, another has floored her adversary,
and is pouring forth the boiling contents of the urn over a prostrate foe. Nails,
fists, and feet are alike set to work; but the favourite method of attack seems to
be a firm purchase of the enemy's tresses. Cats are leaping about in dismay,
and the whole tableau is one of unrestrained ferocity and recklessness.</p>

<p><i>March 1, 1815.</i> <cite>Defrauding the Customs, or Shipping Goods not Fairly
Entered.</cite> Rowlandson del. Published by T. Tegg (344).&mdash;A scene of violence,
since a pair of strapping damsels, the pride of their friends, are being carried off
bodily, whether they will or no, by two naval officers, whose sailors are waiting
by the shore, with a boat put to sea in readiness to bear them, and their abducted
charges, off to a ship which is seen at a distance. These unprincipled marauders
have made an attack, in broad daylight, on the two biggest and most handsome
scholars of <em>Mrs. Crostich's boarding-school for young ladies</em>, while the remainder
of the tender flock are taking their walks abroad, with the dame at their head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_290" id="Page_ii_290">[290]</a></span>
But neither the vigorous efforts of the schoolmistress, nor the exertions of an
old gentleman, who has been knocked over in the escape, and is sprawling
powerless like a turtle, nor the efforts of a dog which is worrying the retreat
of the fugitives, seem likely to hinder the accomplishment of their flight or to
prevent the successful completion of their lawless designs.</p>

<p><i>March 1, 1815.</i> <cite>Hodge's Explanation of a Hundred Magistrates.</cite> Published
by T. Tegg (347).&mdash;Hodge, 'a poor honest country lout, not overstocked with
learning,' has been brought before the bench on some charge or another. The
smock-frocked rustic, cap in hand, is scratching his tow-like locks and questioning
the fairness of the tribunal. 'How,' cries the chairman, energetically thumping
away at the table in his indignation, 'how dare you, fellow, say it is unfair
to bring you before one hundred magistrates, when you see there are but three
of us?' In reply to which Hodge is posing his interrogator: 'Why, please
your worship, you mun know when I went to school they taught I that a one
and two noughts stood for a hundred; so, do you see, your worship be one, and
the other two be cyphers!'</p>

<p><i>March 1, 1815.</i> <cite>Sailors Drinking the Tunbridge Waters.</cite> Published by T.
Tegg (242).&mdash;The artist has sketched the old drinking-well at Tunbridge; a
body of sailors, true British tars, find themselves, by some queer chance, which
is totally unexplained, at the well-known watering-place, and, what is more
mysterious, these sons of Neptune are in close proximity to the Springs. A
comely, well-favoured, and smartly attired young damsel, the ministering nymph
of the fountain&mdash;which, in this instance, it must be confessed, closely resembles a
pump&mdash;is presenting a tumbler of the fluid, drawn by her own fair hands, to a
sturdy ancient coxswain, impressing on the weather-beaten salt, 'Be assured it
is an excellent beverage for gentlemen who have been a long time at sea.' The
ancient mariner, in recalling the effects which the waters had on 'our Poll,' and
remembering his own personal interior sufferings in the Mediterranean, is reluctant
to rush into unknown dangers: 'Why, lookee, ma'am, I don't wish to
be unpolite, but, if your ladyship's honour pleases, I'd rather hang fire a bit.'
Another hardy tar is grappling with the distasteful difficulty and making frightful
attempts to swallow the contents of his tumbler; but a good proportion of the
water is spilt on the ground, while he is pronouncing the stuff 'Dashed queer
tipple, to be sure!' Another smart sailor has his tumbler all safe in his keeping;
but he is bribing a diminutive native, who is complacently staring at the prospective
drinker, to run and fetch something to qualify the cup. 'Hark'ee,
young two-shoes, go and get me a pint of half-and-half and a squeeze of lemon,
for darn me if I could drink it neat if I was never to weigh anchor again.'</p>

<p><i>April 7, 1815.</i> <cite>The Flight of Buonaparte from Hell-Bay.</cite> Published by R.
Ackermann.&mdash;We find the anticipations offered in the caricatures of the previous
year completely upset by Napoleon's unexpected return. The method of the
Corsican's evasion is treated figuratively; in place of the Isle of Elba he is
supposed to have escaped from the clutches of the evil one and out of the depths
of the infernal regions. The foul fiend, <em>Old Scratch</em>, is represented in person,
amusing himself by letting his captive loose to work fresh mischief in the world
above. A diabolic armchair of serpents is planted beside the fiery lake, and for
pastime Satan is toying with a pipe and blowing air-bubbles, while an attendant
imp is holding a saucer of suds. The Corsican has been mounted on a bubble
blown by the tempter, and then sent careering back to earth; hissing dragons,
and serpents of supernatural species, are hissing forth flames and blasts of fury,
which are serving as winds to waft the bubble upwards, while the sulphurous
fumes are inspiring the rider with a frantic thirst for vengeance.</p>

<p><i>April 8, 1815.</i> <cite>Hell Hounds Rallying round the Idol of France.</cite> Published
by R. Ackermann.&mdash;The enthusiasm with which the return of 'Boney' was hailed,
from his landing in France till his arrival in the capital, and the devoted reception
he encountered from his old followers, are made the subjects of more than one
travesty. In the present case the head and bust of the Emperor, on a colossal
scale&mdash;his throat encircled by a hangman's noose&mdash;is elevated on an immense
pyramid of human heads, his decapitated victims; a brace of demons are flying
through the air to encircle the brow of this apostle of freedom with a crown of
blazing pitch. A ring of excited demons, with horns, claws, hoofs, and tails, but
bearing the heads and faces of Napoleon's supporters, are dancing in triumph
round the idol they have replaced. From labels attached to the ropes which
surround the throttles of these enthusiastic Bonapartists we discover the so-called
'Hell Hounds' to be Marshals Ney, Lefebre, Davoust, Vandamme, Savery,
Caulincourt, with Fouch&eacute;, and others. The old slaughters have recommenced;
towns are committed to the flames, English goods are once more destroyed, and
heaped around are soldiers, some dead and others wounded, to serve the cause
of a rapacious ambition which had drained the blood of France for years.</p>

<p>1815. <cite>Vive le Roi! Vive l'Empereur! Vive le Diable! French Constancy
and French Integrity.</cite>&mdash;As might have been foreseen, Napoleon's old ascendency
over the French army asserted itself more strongly than ever; the intermediate
state of things and the humiliations to which the country was unavoidably forced
to submit during the process of restoring the stolen property and possessions to the
rightful owners had increased the national animosity with which the troops and
the people continued to regard the foreign invaders, friends, allies, and upholders
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louis le Desir&eacute;</i>. The more martial spirits, wearied of a restoration with
which France felt no sympathy, began to languish for the presence of their great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_292" id="Page_ii_292">[292]</a></span>
captain, under whose military empire their laurels had been won. The fickleness
and instability of the Gallic race are set forth in the present caricature. A trooper
has abjured his allegiance to the Bourbons, and is hailing his Corporal with a
pinch from his snuffbox; his hat is still garnished with the white cockade, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive
le Roi!</i> above it is a red one, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive le Diable!</i> and, on the other side, the famous
tricolor, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive l'Empereur!</i> <em>French Constancy</em> is illustrated in these interchanged
emblems. <em>French Stability</em> appears figuratively likened to the sails of
a windmill; as to <em>French Integrity</em>, the emblems of a monkey and cat, kissing
and fondling, pictorially sets forth the 'union between the National Guard and
the troops of the line.'</p>

<p><i>April 12, 1815.</i> <cite>Scene in a New Pantomime, to be performed at the Theatre
Royal, Paris. With entire new music, dances, dresses, scenery, machinery, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. The principal characters to be supported by most of the great potentates in
Europe. Harlequin by Monsieur Napoleon; Clown by King of Wirtemberg;
Pantaloon, Emperor of Austria. To conclude with a comic song, to be sung by the
Pope, and a grand chorus by the Crowned Heads. Vivant Rex et Regina.</cite> Published
by R. Ackermann.&mdash;The wonderful exhibition is taking place in the state
rooms of the Tuileries. The great throne is empty, and the sceptre and crown
are temporarily laid on the steps waiting for their owner. <em>Presto!</em> and in flies
Harlequin Bonaparte, pursued at once by all the Powers of Europe, tumbling
over one another in confusion, but all armed and aiming at the nimble sprite,
who had given them so much trouble to capture and secure, and who is once
more to be chased, caught, and bound down again. Clown Wirtemberg is letting
off a brace of pistols; Dutch Mynheer and a Prussian grenadier are discharging
their blunderbusses; Austria, as Pantaloon, is too startled to be effective; the
Cossack is giving the fugitive a prod with his long lance; the King of Spain
has drawn the sword and aimed such a blow that it has capsized the swordsman
and shaken off his crown; the Pope is armed with an axe; and all the other
potentates are crowding in, an irregular mob. The portrait of the Empress, as
Columbine, is being taken off the walls. As to the Harlequin, his eye looks
dangerous; a dagger is held in either hand-he evidently means mischief; one
tiger-like spring, and he has eluded all his pursuers, and the blows they are
intending for him recoil on themselves. The portrait of Louis the Eighteenth
is in the pathway for which he is making, and the nimble Corsican, in his
character of Harlequin, is jumping clean through the huge paunch of the tranquil
Bourbon and regaining the security of his old strongholds.</p>

<p><i>April 16, 1815.</i> <cite>The Corsican and his Blood Hounds at the Window of the
Tuileries, looking over Paris.</cite> Published by R. Ackermann.&mdash;Boney, on his
arrival in Paris, proceeded to his old quarters in the Tuileries, whence Louis
the Eighteenth had but just departed. Napoleon, in spite of his fatigue&mdash;for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_293" id="Page_ii_293">[293]</a></span>
had barely rested since his landing&mdash;sat up all night, concerting fresh measures
with his supporters; and in the morning he held a grand review in the Champ
de Mars, where his presence excited the most frantic demonstrations of fidelity.
France showed herself intoxicated with joy at the chance of receiving back a
leader with whom she had, inconsistently enough, parted without expressing
much emotion or regret, except so far as the Emperor's more immediate personal
adherents were concerned. In the picture we have the streets of Paris represented
as being filled with a surging multitude of enthusiasts, while standards,
eagles, and heads of enemies are held up on pikes, by the wilder fanatics, as
signs of encouragement. <em>Death</em> and the <em>Devil</em> are tempting the Corsican from
the balcony of the Tuileries; in 'return for more horrors,' and in exchange for
'death and destruction,' all that he sees is offered the conqueror. The bony
skeleton is pointing out the bargain with his dart; but Time's hourglass is
standing unperceived at Napoleon's side and the sand is running forth. The
figure of the Devil is resting his arms fraternally on the shoulders of Boney and
Marshal Ney and drawing them into an ill-starred embrace. The other marshals
and adherents are in the rear; but a marked expression of apprehension is shown
on the faces of the entire party, with the exception of the two supernatural
visitors, who are grinning at the anticipation of fresh iniquities and increasing
deadly horrors, with which they entertain the certain prospect of being gratified
by their pet <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>1815. <cite>R. Ackermann's Transparency on the Victory of Waterloo.</cite>&mdash;The loyal
supporters of the Government and that indomitable British nation which had
declared '<em>no surrender</em> to the Corsican,' and, either in victory or defeat, had
persevered, while their allies were conquered and their subsidies wasted, were
rewarded for the 'outpouring of blood and treasure abroad' and the hard times
and anxieties at home by finding that at last, after Waterloo, their enemy was at
their mercy. Rejoicings, fireworks, and illuminations became the order of the
day; and our artist, who had traced the varying career of the dreaded bugbear
Boney, now lent his assistance to commemorate his downfall. In Rowlandson's
simple allegory Buonaparte, on his white Arab charger, is riding his hardest
away from the British pursuit; he has lost his sword, and his crown is shaken off.
Wellington, with his sword ready to smite, is rapidly coming up with the fugitive,
whose flight, however, is unexpectedly brought to an end by finding old Blucher,
on his sturdy charger, drawn up across the very path he is taking. The redoubtable
veteran is discharging a huge blunderbuss full in the face of the common
enemy. Incidents in the pursuit of the routed French legions are slightly indicated
in the background, and a flight of certain gilded birds are scurrying out of
the dangerous vicinity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_294" id="Page_ii_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p><i>July 28, 1815.</i> <cite>Boney's Trial, Sentence, and Dying Speech, or Europe's
Injuries Revenged.</cite>&mdash;Napoleon is arraigned, as a criminal at the bar, before the
Court of Europe and a crowded tribunal; the seat of chief judge is occupied by
Prince Blucher, and the assembled potentates are seated on the bench, wearing
their recovered crowns, which the prisoner, in his various triumphs, had so often
caused to tremble and, in some cases, had carried off completely. The kings, it
is true, do not make an imposing spectacle; with the exception of the Emperor
Alexander, who is seated beside the Prince Regent, they still seem to look upon
the lately dreaded foe with trepidation. The occupants of the court and the
lawyers are regarding the criminal under sentence with abhorrence; a <em>posse</em> of
tipstaves are drawn up below the prisoner's bar; and Napoleon, who is trying to
move the compassion of his hearers by hypocritical humility, has a friend at his
back, who is ready to seize his bond&mdash;the Black Fiend is his unseen attendant
prompter in person. Old Blucher, clad in his field-marshal's uniform, with the
addition of a judge's wig, is standing up, and, with emphatic gestures, is pointing
to the act of accusation set forth at length on a screen in the court: 'Napoleon
Bonaparte, the first and last by the wrath of Heaven, ex-Emperor of the
Jacobins, and Head-Runner of Runaways, stands indicted: 1. For the murder
of Captain Wright in the Temple, at Paris. 2. For the murder of the Duke
D'Enghien, Pichegru, and Georges. 3. For the murder of Palm, Hofer, &amp;c., &amp;c.
4. For the murder of the twelve inhabitants of Moscow. 5. For innumerable
robberies committed on all nations in Christendom and elsewhere. 6. For
bigamy; and lastly for returning from transportation and setting the world in
an uproar.' The inflexible judge is hurling forth his condemnation: 'You, Nap
Bonaparte, being found guilty of all these crimes, it is fallen to my lot to pronounce
sentence of death on you. You are to be hung by the neck for one
hour till you are <em>dead, dead, dead</em>, and your body to be chained to a millstone
and sunk in the sea at Torbay.' The fallen Emperor is naturally much moved
at this final judgment, and he is interceding for a respite: 'Oh, cruel Blucher!
oh, cruel Wellington! it is you that have brought me to this end. Oh, magnanimous
Emperors, Kings, and Princes, intercede for me and spare my life,
and give me time to atone for all my sins. My son, Napoleon the Second, will
reward you for mercy shown me!'</p>

<p><i>November, 1815.</i> <cite>Transparency Exhibited at R. Ackermann's, in the Strand,
on November 27, 1815, the day on which the General Peace was celebrated in
London.</cite>&mdash;As all England was exerting itself to display its loyalty and the universal
delight occasioned by the conclusion of the Continental wars, Rowlandson
contributed a characteristic cartoon, which appeared, like its predecessors, outside
the Repository of Arts, allegorically commemorating the downfall of 'Boney'
and the second restoration of the legitimate reigning house. The design of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_295" id="Page_ii_295">[295]</a></span>
transparency was arranged in the form of a monument, capped by a throne; at
the base is a trophy; the Prince of Wales's plume is waving above two gilt
tablets, inscribed with the names of the two victorious generals, Wellington and
Blucher, and surrounded by pieces of dismounted artillery and groups of standards,
with the Union Jack and the Russian and Prussian flags in front. Above
this group is a base, inscribed, 'Peace throughout Europe,' with a tablet, '<em>Charlemagne,
Nassau, Capet, Bourbon</em>,' and two wreaths, dedicated to '<em>Humanity</em>'
and '<em>Justice</em>.' Upon this platform a canopy is raised aloft, festooned above the
throne of St. Louis, with the restored crown; a serpent, emblematic of eternity,
and the three doves; the front of the seat is supported by bundles of fasces, with
double axes, and classic wreaths and lyres. A flight of steps mounts up to the
throne on either side. On the right is Wellington, supporting Louis XVIII.,
restored to his rights; his train are following the ascent of their sovereign,
and the figure of <em>Justice</em> is floating on the clouds above the monarch's head.
<em>Fame</em> is blowing her trumpet on the other side; while Bonaparte and his baffled
supporters are effecting a rapid descent by the left-hand staircase; Blucher,
standing on the top step, is making their defeat secure by a discharge from his
huge blunderbuss. Bodies of the Allied troops are drawn up at the base; on the
right a group of Cossacks, with Prussian and English cavalry; on the left is a
gathering of the various foot-soldiers. A sturdy Highlander is putting the finishing
stroke to a discomfited plotting Bonapartist with his bayonet, and summarily
stamping out Imperialist intriguers.</p>

<p>1815. <cite>Measuring Substitutes for the Army of Reserve.</cite>&mdash;In 1815, owing to
the French wars, soldiers were necessarily at a premium; and, from an advertisement
in the justices' room, where the substitutes are being measured, we learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_296" id="Page_ii_296">[296]</a></span>
that the bounty was fixed at 30<i>l.</i> per man. Those great functionaries, a country
justice and his clerk, appear seated in state, to warrant the proceedings. A
commanding officer and his sergeant are labouring prodigiously, for the needs of
the service, to force certain stunted and misshapen rustics, who have been enlisted
to serve their country, up to the military standard. Further relays of
ungainly 'chawbacons' are waiting their turn without.</p>

<p>1815. <cite>A Journeyman Tailor.</cite>&mdash;A half-clad slave of the thimble is shown
squatting on his board in a squalid hovel; his half-starved 'helper' is seated by
his side; both are pressing garments with hot irons, and a rough and ragged
urchin is heating a further supply of the article known as 'a tailor's goose' at the
grate; while a street hawker, a blowsy Hibernian, is screaming her wares (cucumbers
and cabbages) in at the doorway. This picture bears some resemblance to
a caricature published by Rowlandson in 1823, under the title <cite>Hot Goose, Cabbage,
and Cucumbers</cite>.</p>

<p>1815. <cite>Neighbours.</cite> Published by T. Tegg (235).&mdash;The wooden casements of
two windows, which turn on one post connecting the houses, are thrown back, and
simultaneously a neat-looking young farmer and a well-favoured young damsel
are stooping forward and their lips meeting in a cheerful salute, to the horror and
scandal of two elderly witnesses, who are expressing their reprobation at the
openness of the proceeding. The young swain at the same moment is trying to
hang up a cage, which appropriately contains a pair of cooing doves.</p>

offer the feeblest resistance. The night watchman is going his rounds, and
enjoying a laugh at the expense of the victim; this trustworthy guardian of the
streets is too evidently a confederate of the predative fair, and is personally
interested in the plunder.</p>

<p>1815. <cite>Accidents will Happen.</cite>&mdash;This, and the following subjects, to the
number of half-a-dozen, are selected from prints in some degree pirated from
Rowlandson, and, although bearing his name in the corner, in many instances
the incidents of well-known caricatures have been altered, and prints have been
issued, engraved in an inferior style, as new caricatures. The principal of these
adaptations, or poor renderings of drawings, were published by Marks. <em>Accidents
will Happen</em> introduces a cellar incident. A maid has begun to descend the
stairs to draw some beer, and has come to grief, probably from fright, as files of
scared rats are scampering away, and a cat is tearing up the wall, while a mischievous
monkey has broken loose from his chain. The shock has caused the
damsel to lose her balance, her pitcher is broken, and she is sprawling in an
attitude which has astonished her master, who, candle in hand, is coming down
the winding stairs of the cellar to survey the scene of the disaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_298" id="Page_ii_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>1815. <cite>Sympathy.</cite>&mdash;This emotion is rendered in the feelings of a stern
functionary, evoked in favour of a lady in Bridewell, who is being led out of the
cells by the warder to be flogged, a punishment which, it would seem, had not
been abolished in Rowlandson's day. The eye of the coarse and elephantine
jailer is gloating over the fair back of the unfortunate criminal, laid bare for the
application of the cat.</p>

<p>1815. <cite>Despatch, or Jack preparing for Sea.</cite>&mdash;Jack Tar is making the most
of his opportunities on shore; he is surrounded by the delights which constitute
the sailor's elysium; punch and grog galore, a brace of fiddlers, and a bevy of
beauties, florid Pollies of Portsmouth, towards whom he is making tipsy demonstrations
of affection. In those days, when prize-money fell in golden showers,
the valiant sea-dogs who defended our shores, and made John Bull's name redoubtable
on the ocean, were able to command, in their short intervals on shore,
luxuries after their own hearts, for which, after the dangers and hardships of
active service, they threw away their 'yellow boys' with the recklessness which
characterised their habits, and proved a rich harvest to the plunderers who were
on the watch for seamen just 'paid off.'</p>

<p>1815. <cite>Deadly Lively.</cite>&mdash;The coarse humours of a spirit-cellar are served up
with a tragic accompaniment. A young female is stretched incapable and asleep,
sunk in all the degradation of dead drunkenness. A man who is no longer master
of himself is raising his tumbler, with a tipsy desire to have it replenished. The
apparition of King Death, bony, frightful, and sinister, is grinning over the back
of the soddened tippler's chair, recruiting his legions from a fruitful source; he
is supplying the rummer of the drunken wretch from his own vial, little more fatal
than the fluid which is debasing and deadening its victims around. A stout
woman, also sinking into tipsy apathy, is roused by the shock of finding the king
of terrors added to the company; she is thrown off her balance with a start, and,
falling backwards on the stone floor of the vault, she will probably break her neck&mdash;as

<p><a href="#LETTER"><cite>The Letter Writer.</cite></a>&mdash;'On our way to the mole we had some difficulty in passing
through a crowd of people, who, with great eagerness, and with Neapolitan clamour,
had assembled round a man, sitting with pen and ink before a frail table, busily
employed in committing to paper the crude thoughts of a country clown in the
attitude of dictating to him; for the noise was too loud to hear what was going
forward. A board above the head of the engrosser proclaimed his calling: '<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Qui si
fanno memoriali, lettere, ed altre scritture, nel ottimo stilo moderno.</i>' (Here are
drawn up memorials, letters, and other writings, in the best modern style.) Ever
eager to seize any opportunity of observing the manners and national character of
a people whom I have every reason to think better of than some of our superficial
magpie-tourists, I pressed forward to obtain a nearer view of the transactions of
this universal secretary, when my companion, Don Michele, pulling me back by the
skirt of my coat, begged I would not demean myself by thus mixing with the vulgar.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'The composer of letters was just receiving from an elderly woman the sum
of six <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">grani</i> (about threepence) for an epistle he had indited to her son at <em>Bari</em>;
after which a farmer, next in rotation, was admitted into presence. His business
appeared to be on secret service, for the corresponding oracle politely requested
some of the more curious auditors to step a little aside. At first, indeed, the
farmer's instructions were conveyed in a whisper; but as a Neapolitan loves
dearly to talk as loud as his lungs will let him, and to accompany his sermocinations
with the most expressive gestures, it soon became less difficult to discover
that the subject under present consideration was a horse which had been sold to
a cavalry officer, and for which a balance was still owing; the prompt payment
whereof was to be peremptorily insisted on by a respectful dun. As soon as a
period was happily brought to paper, it was read over to the listening clodhopper,
who, in a manner, beat time to the emphatic and rhythmical reading of
the professor by periodical nods of the head, and at the end of the sentence expressed
his astonishment at the sagacity with which his obscure ideas had been
caught up and classified. This literary production, owing probably to the importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_303" id="Page_ii_303">[303]</a></span>
of the subject, was disposed of for the valuable consideration of eight
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">grani</i> (fourpence), paper included; and its possessor, with inward satisfaction,
left the oracular tripod, in order to make room for a Turkish captain of a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">polacca</i>,
whose literary necessities consisted in a memorial claiming the restitution of
some goods illegally seized.... When the document was ready for signature,
<em>Ibrahim Reis</em>, who could neither read nor write, was desired to make his <em>cross</em> at
foot, which he refused with religious abhorrence; but, dipping his little finger
into the inkstand, imprinted on the paper a correct facsimile of the tortuous
furrows of his cuticle by way of signet. To my great surprise, this state paper
was valued at no more than one carlin (fivepence), although engrossed on a
folio page and decorated with some fancifully flourished initials.</p>

<div class="caption">THE LETTER-WRITER.</div>
</div>

<p>'The Turk no sooner discharged his literary debt than a well-dressed young
lass gained his place. (This interview is pictured forth in the artist's illustration.)
The despatch, however, which was to be written for her, must have been on
secret and confidential service, for the instructions she gave to the engrosser
were communicated in so low a whisper that, from my observatory, the scene
appeared one of purely pantomimical action. When I relate that the time employed
by this universal author in the production of the farmer's dun and the
Turk's memorial did not exceed half an hour, and that the contents, although
somewhat fustian, were very much to the purpose, you will agree with me that
Signor Bucatelli possessed talents far above his station. Indeed, Don Matteo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_304" id="Page_ii_304">[304]</a></span>
assured me that he was as good a poet as an epistolary writer, and that his
sonnets on any particular occasion, such as for a wedding, a birthday, &amp;c., may
be obtained on the shortest notice, and at equally reasonable rates; in short,
that he could wield his pen on any subject whatsoever.</p>

<p>'To a publisher in England a man like Signor Bucatelli would be an invaluable
treasure, a host within himself, by the versatility of his genius and the despatch
of his literary labours: his charges of <em>authorship</em>, as you have seen, are consonant
with the modesty of true genius. His elevated style of writing (truly <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">nel ottimo
stilo moderno</i>) would soon render him a most popular author with us. I was
just going to step down to give him the substance of a poetical epistle as a
specimen of his abilities, when a little girl brought him a small dish of stewed
Windsor beans, a large raw cucumber, and a crust of bread. This frugal fare,
and a glass of iced water from the neighbouring stall, well calculated to preserve
his intellectual powers unclogged, Don Matteo informed me, was the whole of his
dinner; which, together with a cigar by way of dessert, interrupted his official
duties for about half an hour, after which, if matters of pressing service remained
to be despatched, he would resume his quill, and suspend his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">siesta</i>, or afternoon
nap, to a late hour of the day.'</p>

<p><a href="#DON_LUIGI"><cite>Don Luigi's Ball.</cite></a>&mdash;Before leaving his apartments on the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Infrescata</i> the writer
was anxious, as a slight return for the kindness of his host and the hospitalities
he had received in Naples, to give a dance to a few friends of his own and of his
entertainer, his host and friend Don Michele undertaking the entire responsibilities
of inviting the guests, ordering refreshments, decorating the chambers, and other
preliminaries.</p>

<p>'"First, as to the company," reports the Don, "there will be ten couples,
besides our family and odd ones, if they all come, of which there is little doubt;
and what is more, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">gente di garbo</i> (people of quality), such as you might suppose
my friends to be. Three or four will come in their own carriages; and some of
the lasses will show you what is called dancing at Naples. Care, too, has been
taken that they should not want for good music; you will have, Signor Don
Luigi, the first oboe of St. Carlo, two excellent violins, a flute, tenor, and
violoncel; my son will play the tambarine."</p>

<p>'"Six musicians, Don Michele, for this little dance! Why, that's out of all
reason. Half the number&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>'"Are <em>hired</em>; and the others, gentlemen high in the profession, who for <em>my</em>
sake have promised to assist as friends at your party. Money, of course, is out
of the question. You see, good sir, Don Michele can command a thing or two.
As many more would have come if I had asked them, but these will be sufficient
to begin the evening with a little concert; my friend will give you a concerto on the
oboe; one of the ladies will sing a <em>scena</em> from an opera, to which we may add a duet or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_305" id="Page_ii_305">[305]</a></span>
two; and at ten o'clock the dance shall begin. As to the refreshments, I have
almost run my legs off to get you the rum (the ladies were to be treated with ice
punch, as a rarity). Seventy ices are ordered, cakes and sweetmeats as you
desired, and a friend of mine will lend us a dozen of wall chandeliers." These
lights, connected with festoons of artificial flowers, and a number of pots of
flowers exhaling their fragrance over the rooms, gave the place an elegant
appearance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="DON_LUIGI"></a><img src="images/i_318.jpg" width="600" height="351" alt="" />
<div class="caption">DON LUIGI'S BALL.</div>
</div>

<p>'The musicians arrived in good time, and the company dropped in fast after
eight o'clock. To receive such a number of strange faces appropriately was a
most irksome task,' continues the writer; 'but it was alleviated by the sight of
many a good-looking young lass, and two or three real beauties, and one especially,
Donna Carlina. My English friends from the city, and the lieutenant and
doctor from the frigate, likewise made their appearance in due time; and
healthily as their countenances shone forth, and well-dressed as they were, they
greatly eclipsed my Neapolitan bucks, and found much grace among the ladies.
I could not help remarking the contrast of manners between two Christian countries.
In a more northern latitude, persons coming to the party of a perfect
stranger would have conducted themselves with that cautious, anti-social reserve
which some people call good manners; some of the ladies would have sat down
on their chairs as prim and as stiff as so many hop-poles, cast down their modest
looks until spoken to by charity, and then rebuffed a second attempt by a monosyllabic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_306" id="Page_ii_306">[306]</a></span>
reply, a "Yes, sir," an "Indeed, sir?" a "You are very good, sir," &amp;c.
Now I will just tell you how matters went on in the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Infrescata</i>. Monstrous bows
and introductory compliments: this over, all these people seemed as though
they had been twenty times in my company.' The Don describes the improvised
introductory concert, at which nearly all the company assisted, the Neapolitans
having a natural taste for melody, and most of them being fair musicians; the
entertainer next gave orders to prepare for the dance, and to hand refreshments
in the interval.</p>

<p>'My punch,' he continues, 'found much favour with all present, the ladies not
excepted, who emptied their glasses as rapidly as if it had been lemonade. Although
not dancing, I was fully employed in another way. With all our windows
open, the strains of my numerous orchestra propagated their sound over the
whole neighbourhood, some of whose inhabitants, impelled by the attraction of
sweet sounds, could not resist favouring me with their company. The circumstance
of their not being invited to the feast appeared to them a mere trifle not
worthy of their attention; and an extraordinary celerity in decorating their exterior
(which is all the essential part of a Neapolitan's full dress), would soon
enable them to appear in company with Neapolitan decency. To my great
surprise, therefore, Don Michele and I had to receive, from time to time, an
influx of these unbidden guests, who in most submissive language begged a
thousand pardons for their freedom and intrusion. As Don Michele, my master
of the ceremonies, seemed to know them all, and, moreover, as I could neither
help their coming, nor, when once arrived, turn them out, I thought it best to
put a good face on the matter, and receive every one, especially the ladies, with
a hearty welcome (as pictured forth in the plate), assigning them places in the
adjoining room, where I contrived to form another set of dances; for the number
of these parasitical guests soon grew nearly equal to that of my standard company.
As my company were now capering away in two of my apartments, I
blush to confess that my resolution to keep my toes in a state of quiet quiescence
was shaken at last. I could have withstood the pressing solicitations of half-a-dozen
of these exhilarated damsels, but for the irresistible temptation of their
animated example, and of the excellent music. Fancy the loving smiles, the glistening
eyes, the seducing attitudes of these pretty Neapolitan bacchantes, and then
ask your conscience how long any Christian, were he even a Quaker or Moravian,
could have stood proof against such attraction? The worst of the thing was,
that having once broken my vow by dancing with Miss Carlina, a kind of rivalry
ensued among the other ladies, most of whom now laid a successive claim to be
led down a country dance by <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">il Signor Colonello</i>.</p>

<p>'In the course of these pedestrian evolutions I thought I observed in several
of my fair partners, cheerful as they had been before, an unusual and extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_307" id="Page_ii_307">[307]</a></span>
access of spirits and gaiety; which, with every allowance for the southern latitude
and the ice punch (now administered to them the more frugally by reason of the
unlooked-for increase in my numbers), I was at a loss to account for, till I saw
my man Benedetto whisper something into Don Michele's ear, which the latter
telegraphed into mine.</p>

<p>'But before I let you into this secret it is proper that, like a skilful general, I
should in my report give a correct description of the localities of the field of
battle. The kitchen belonging to my apartments is on the same floor with
them, and in this particular the Neapolitan system of domestic architecture is
not different from what you may have observed in a set of chambers, or in many
old-fashioned mansions in England. Right opposite to the entrance of this
kitchen of mine there is an elevated shelf, on which stand (I had better say
<em>stood</em>) my three wine-bottles, of immense calibre; the first (having been emptied
since my stay in the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Infrescata</i>) then, and now, containing from six to eight
gallons of excellent atmospheric air (such as you breathe at this altitude); the
second, of similar dimensions, about half full of delicious old <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pozzuoli</i> wine; and
the third, not less in size, brim-full of the like grape-juice, with its fluid oil-bung
floating at the top.</p>

<p>'No sooner did one of the damsels espy the forbidden shelf than the assault
thereon was a settled matter: <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">veni, vidi, bibi</i>, was the word; and my delicious
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pozzuoli</i> wine fell an easy prey to their sacrilegious hands and palate. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Implentur
veteris Bacchi</i>, or, in plain English, mesdames tippled till they had their fill, and
what they left was very nearly finished by four or five half-starved footmen and
other hall rabble in attendance on their worthy masters; for when Don Michele
went into the kitchen he found but a small remnant in one of the bottles, which
he secured in his own room.</p>

<p>'Inspired with the juice and further excited by the agitation of dancing, most
of my fair guests became still more exhilarated; some grew ecstatically merry,
and a few scarcely manageable. Surrounded by these voluptuous "bacch&aelig;," I
feared the fate of Orpheus. Their frolics, however, I must say to their credit,
were chiefly levelled at Don Michele, probably because he had spoiled the continuation
of their sport. The poor man had now to suffer all sorts of mischief for
refusing to join in their revels, till at last, for the sake of peace, he consented to
dance <em>one</em> minuet, and no more. All was hushed in an instant, when he placed
himself with his fortunate partner in the middle of the room, as stiff as buckram
and as serious as if he were occupied with the solution of an algebraic problem.
But no sooner had he performed the first step or two, than, in turning his body
with grave elegance on the pivot of his toe, a pair of white silk garters were seen
gracefully dangling down his back, and describing, at every turn of his automaton
body, a variety of flowing irregular curves in the circumambient air. The merriment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_308" id="Page_ii_308">[308]</a></span>
which this unusual sight occasioned, was in vain attempted to be stifled in a
muttered titter; it soon burst out with increased violence, his wife not excepted,
who heartily joined the general laugh, but informed her better half of the cause
of the satisfaction he gave the company. When I learned the extent of the
spoliation committed upon my bin, I did not so much regret the actual loss I
thereby sustained, as apprehend some unpleasant scenes of interruption to our
festivity and mirth from the excessive indulgence in the forbidden juice. However,
whether it was owing to the excellence of the vintage, or to strength of
constitution in the fair partakers, only one casualty occurred.</p>

<p>'The dawn of morn was the signal for the gradual separation of the company,
from all of whom, whether of the establishment or extra guests, I had received
in the course of the evening the most pressing requests to make their house my
own; and to their credit I must say that, as far as I have yet had time or inclination
to try the sincerity of their invitations, I have had no cause to regret
my complaisance.</p>

<p>'When I relate that five leaden ice-moulds and eight of the confectioner's
pewter spoons were missing, you will scarcely suppose that any of the good
things, such as cakes, sweetmeats, &amp;c., were suffered to remain on the sideboard
at the departure of my guests. Whether this practice not to "leave a wreck
behind" is as general here as in Malta, I am unable to decide. At the latter
place, let the provision be ever so abundant, what the stomach cannot compass
the pockets are sure to hold, and in stuffing those no great nicety is observed;
so the article is portable at all, it finds its way into one or the other of the
pedestrian saddle-bags as by instinct. I have been assured by one of our
officers that, at a great f&ecirc;te which General Fox recently gave at Malta, one of
the inhabitants (of sufficient rank to be of the party) very dexterously, and, as
he fancied, unobserved, slipped a small pullet, wrapt in his pocket-handkerchief,
into one of his side receptacles. Unfortunately, an officer near him, seeing the
sleight-of-hand transaction, poured a dose of parsley and butter after it, saying
very coolly, "Allow me, sir, to help you to a little sauce at the same time."'</p>

<h2><a name="d1816" id="d1816"></a>1816.</h2>


<p><i>January 10, 1816.</i> <cite>Exhibition at Bullock's Museum of Bonaparte's Carriage
taken at Waterloo.</cite> Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;Bullock's museum
of natural curiosities was the receptacle for most of the novelties introduced to the
British public at the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth
centuries. It was here that the sight-seer might view the Laplanders with
their deer and sledges, the Hottentot Venus, the Polish dwarf, the Irish giant,
and other marvels for the curious which happened to hit the capricious taste of
the hour. It seems that the relics of the first Napoleon, made familiar enough
to our generation at Madame Tussaud's Baker Street Museum, were the chief
attractions held out by the earlier Bullock in 1816. The central point of the
collection is the Emperor's travelling carriage; ladies are swarming and climbing
over the vehicle, being pushed, dragged, and lifted into the inside, on to the
driving-box, over the roof, into the boot behind, on the wheels, and, in fact,
wherever a foothold can be secured. There is an animated attendance of
visitors; the fair sex are particularly distinguishing themselves. Other personal
relics of the Corsican are spread about, much as we see them in our day; the
bust of the exile is placed by the side of a monkey, an illustration of the prejudice
in which Napoleon was held at that period, which, by the way, is not unnatural,

An officer, dressed as a hussar, is standing in the centre, while being submitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_310" id="Page_ii_310">[310]</a></span>
to the whitewashing process; he wears no sword, and is holding a written
defence in one hand. Above his head appears an arm, also belonging to an
officer, which is menacing the hussar, who is appealing to his friends: 'O save
my honour. Rub away, my friend, rub it <em>home</em>. O, 'tis the phantom of a horrid
dream.' Another officer, from his uniform apparently in the Guards, is treading
on a written 'oath,' and, with a pail of whitewash, is doing his best for the so-called
'Blackamoor,' declaring, 'We'll say nothing about your honour!' Another
friend, in a Highland uniform, evidently a person of rank, since he wears a red
riband, and has a star on his breast, is trying to obliterate the mark of a kick,
which has left an ugly outline of a foot on the white pantaloons of the injured
individual, but the impression is ineradicable: 'Deel o' me saul, mon, but the
stain of the foot will ne'er come oot.'</p>

<p>1816. <a href="#L_HAMILTON"><cite>Lady Hamilton at Home, or a Neapolitan Ambassador.</cite></a>&mdash;The outline
of this subject, which is not without its interest as a contemporary sketch of a
celebrated trio, is from an original drawing in the collection of the present writer.
There seems some discrepancy about the date, since Sir William Hamilton died
in 1803, and the sketch evidently belongs to the latter period of the ambassador's
life. Sir William Hamilton, whose collection of antiques formed a valuable addition
to the national collection in the British Museum, was, it will be remembered,
successful in rendering such services to Admiral Nelson, by his influence with
the court of Naples, where he resided as British ambassador, that our naval hero
was enabled to refit and victual his fleet entirely, without losing the time which
would have been sacrificed in returning to England, and thus contributed in a
marked degree to assist Nelson in surprising the French fleet in Aboukir Bay,
resulting in the famous victory of the Nile, which first checked the tide of Napoleon's
career, crippled the power of France, and finally compelled the armies
of the Republic to withdraw from Egypt. Lady Hamilton's exertions with the
Queen of Naples, over whom she had gained considerable ascendency, were not
without their national importance, although her services were entirely ignored in
the lady's last days, at a time when the Government left her without that future
provision which Nelson, in falling fighting in his country's cause, and bequeathing
her claims as a legacy to the nation, imagined he was securing for the support
of his friend, who, it is reported, died in abject poverty, if she did not perish of
actual want, as it has been hinted. In Rowlandson's drawing, Lady Hamilton,
in classic garb, is watering a plant placed in a classic vase; ancient busts,
candelabra, and urns are standing about; the furniture, implements, and accessories
are all fashioned after the antique. The caricaturist has taken certain
freedoms with the person of the Neapolitan ambassador, and Sir William is
travestied as a stout personage, suffering from the gout. Another female figure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_311" id="Page_ii_311">[311]</a></span>
also draped after the antique, is touching a lyre, and chanting certain ditties of
her own composition; this lady represents Miss Cornelia Knight (an authoress
of some repute in her day, whose small notoriety rests on her <em>Continuation of
Rasselas</em>, and her <em>Private Life of the Romans</em>)<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> who travelled in the suite of the
ambassador with his lady.</p>

<a id="L_HAMILTON"></a><img src="images/i_324.jpg" width="600" height="374" alt="" />
<div class="caption">LADY HAMILTON AT HOME.</div>
</div>

<p>A familiar description of Lady Hamilton and her party occurs in a diary by
Mrs. Colonel St. George, written during her sojourn among the German courts,
1799 and 1800, and privately printed. The traveller happened to be stopping
in Dresden in October 1800, when Lord Nelson, Sir William Hamilton, Lady
Hamilton, her mother Mrs. Cadogan, and the poetess arrived, and were received
by Mr. Elliot, the English ambassador.</p>

<p>The portrait of Lady Hamilton is firmly drawn. Mrs. St. George thus
describes the famous 'Emma,' of whose features so many admirable paintings
exist limned by the hand of Romney. 'Her figure is colossal, but, excepting her
feet, well shaped. Her bones are large, and she is exceedingly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embonpoint</i>.
She resembles the bust of Ariadne: the shape of all her features is fine, as is the
form of her head, and particularly her ears; her teeth are a little irregular,
but tolerably white; her eyes light blue, with a brown spot in one, which, though
a defect, takes nothing away from their beauty and expression. Her eyebrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_312" id="Page_ii_312">[312]</a></span>
and hair are dark, and her complexion coarse. Her expression is strongly
marked, variable, and interesting; her movements in common life ungraceful;
her voice loud yet not disagreeable. Sir William is old, infirm, all admiration of
his wife, and never spoke to-day but to applaud her. Miss Cornelia Knight
seems the decided flatterer of the two, and never opens her mouth but to show
forth their praise; and Mrs. Cadogan, Lady Hamilton's mother, is what one
might expect. After dinner we had several songs in honour of Lord Nelson,
written by Miss Knight, and sung by Lady Hamilton. She puffs the incense
full in his face, but he receives it with pleasure, and sniffs it up very cordially.</p>

<p>'<i>October 7.</i>&mdash;Breakfasted with Lady Hamilton, and saw her represent in
succession the best statues and paintings extant. She assumes their attitude,
expression, and drapery, with great facility, swiftness, and accuracy. Several
Indian shawls, a chair, some antique vases, a wreath of roses, a tamborine, and
a few children are her whole apparatus. She stands at one end of the room
with a strong light on her left, and every other window closed. Her hair is
short, dressed like an antique, and her gown a simple calico chemise, very easy,
with loose sleeves to the wrists. She disposes of the shawls so as to form
Grecian, Turkish, and other drapery, as well as a variety of turbans. Her arrangement
of the turbans is absolutely sleight-of-hand, she does it so quickly,
so easily, and so well. It is a beautiful performance, amusing to the most
ignorant, and highly interesting to the lovers of art. The chief of her imitations
are from the antique. Each representation lasts about ten minutes. It is
remarkable that, coarse and ungraceful in common life, she becomes highly
graceful, and even beautiful, during this performance. After showing her
attitudes, she sang, and I accompanied. Her voice is good and very strong,
but she is frequently out of tune; her expression strongly marked and various;
but she has no flexibility, and no sweetness. She acts her songs.'</p>

<p>1814&ndash;1816. <em>The English Dance of Death.</em> Published at R. Ackermann's,
101 Strand.&mdash;A selection from Rowlandson's famous illustrations to the <cite>Dance
of Death</cite>; an ingenious series, quite suited, in spite of the grimness of the performance,
to the artist's humour. The publication secured great praise during
the designer's lifetime; in point of execution the set leaves nothing to be desired;
in regard to picturesque action and easy grouping, the illustrations will bear
comparison with any of the artist's works. As in the well-known series by
Holbein, Della Bella, &amp;c., Death appears at the most unexpected and inopportune
moments, with that stern and ghastly reminder of the futility of human
pleasures, successes, and pursuits, of which the most playful satirists have never
been able to lose sight.</p>

<p>Death, in Rowlandson's series, displays his acknowledged ubiquity; he
knocks without ceremony at everyone's portal, and none can deny him admission.
Both artist and author seem to have appreciated the resources of their subject so
thoroughly, and have worked out its grotesque spirit with such appropriateness,
that the <cite>Dance of Death</cite> must remain a fitting monument of their genius. A
large circulation could hardly be anticipated for a work conceived in this realistically
fearful vein. Rowlandson has drawn the various episodes which his invention
suggested with a completeness of detail rarely found in his later designs,
and the plates are executed with the fulness and attention of finished drawings;
the figures are delineated with power and spirit, and the backgrounds are most
delicate and suggestive. The impressions are also coloured by hand with a
judicious eye to effect and harmony. Combe has worked with a vigour worthy
of the occasion; and for wit, point, and felicity we are inclined to believe the
versification to the <cite>Dance of Death</cite> surpasses all his other contributions to literature
in this branch. The entire series may be accepted as a work of higher character,
in all respects, than its popular predecessors, the better recognised <cite>Tours of
Doctor Syntax</cite>; and it is superior, beyond comparison, to the works which
followed it.</p>

<p>This series was begun in 1814, and finished in 1816; being issued from the
Repository of Arts in monthly parts, like the <cite>Tour of Doctor Syntax</cite> and successive
works.</p>

<p>The circumstances of its publication are set forth by 'the anonymous author'
(William Combe) in one of his brief explanatory 'introductions.'</p>

<p>'<cite>The Dance of Death</cite> is a subject so well known to have employed the talents
of distinguished painters in the age of superstition, that little is required to recall
it to the recollection of the antiquary, the lover of the arts, and the artist.</p>

<p>'Holbein is more particularly recorded as having employed his pencil upon a
work of this kind; but, without entering into a detail of those masters who have
treated the subject of the <cite>Dance of Death</cite>, the present object is merely to attract
the public attention to the subject itself. Few remains are now visible of the
original paintings which represented it, but they have been perpetuated by the
more durable skill of the engraver, and the volumes which contain them in the
latter form are to be found on the shelves of the learned and curious collector.
The subject is the same in them all, but varied according to the fancy of the
painters, or perhaps from local circumstances attached to the places which they
were respectively intended to decorate. The predominant feature is, without
exception, the representation of one or more skeletons, sometimes indeed in
grotesque attitudes, and with rather a comic effect, conducting persons of all
ranks, conditions, and ages to the tomb.</p>

<p>'Mr. Rowlandson had contemplated the subject with the view of applying it
exclusively to the manners, customs, and character of this country. His pencil
has accordingly produced the designs, which, in the order they were delivered to
me, I have accompanied with metrical illustrations, a mode of proceeding which
has been sanctioned by the success of our joint labours in the <cite>Tour of Doctor
Syntax</cite>. The first volume, therefore, of the English <cite>Dance of Death</cite>, which has
appeared in twelve successive numbers, is now presented to the public in a collected
form. The second volume will follow in the same mode of publication.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_319" id="Page_ii_319">[319]</a></span>
Though the name and tenour of the work is borrowed, it may, perhaps, be allowed
some claim to local and characteristic originality. The most serious
subject attached to our nature is, indeed, presented with a degree of familiar
pleasantry which is not common to it. But in this particular the example of the
painters who first suggested and propagated the idea has been followed, and no
other vivacity has been displayed in these pages than has been found on the walls
of edifices dedicated to religion, and was thus represented in the cloisters of St.
Paul's, before the sacrilegious pride of the Protector Somerset caused the dilapidation
of that appendage to the metropolitan church of the kingdom. But I am
not afraid of being accused by reflecting minds of having introduced an unbecoming
levity into the following pages, for that writer may surely claim the
approbation of the grave and the good who familiarises the mind with Death by
connecting it in any way with the various situations and circumstances of life.</p>

<p>
'<span class="smcap">The Author.</span>'<br />
</p>

<p>The <em>Frontispiece</em> represents the grim form of the spectral foe, his skeleton
frame calmly seated on the globe, his grim jaw resting on his arm, and his elbow
on his knees; at his feet is the hourglass he has borrowed from Time; he wears
the crown, which indicates his universal sovereignty, and in his grasp is the dart
which must touch all humanity in turn, and speed them hence. A pipe and tabor
are suspended overhead, and bats are flitting above. Round the effigy of destruction
are strewn the means wherewith his ends are wrought. A portly
register, '<cite>Death's Dance</cite>,' is open; beside it are the symbolical instruments of his
decrees&mdash;pistols, bullets, daggers, guns, dice, cards, the executioner's axe, a barrel
of gunpowder, compounds, drugs, opium, arsenic, mercury, and the various fatal
agencies arrayed against the natural preservation of life.</p>

<p>A vignette on the engraved <em>Title-page</em> further elucidates the uses of Death's
pipe and tabor. The grim King is enjoying himself in his own fashion, dancing
his rattling bones right merrily to his own music, which he is congenially piping
forth in a cemetery; while the fatal hourglass and dart are laid aside upon the
slab of a grave. Death's grim legions, the skeleton messengers of his decrees,
are dancing fantastic figures with fiendish gaiety among the tombstones, performing
ghastly quadrilles sufficient to scare an involuntary beholder out of his
senses.</p>

two youthful students of the past. The apartment is surrounded with
shelves, loaded with piles of busts and figures of the illustrious dead, the effigies
of renowned poets, generals, philosophers, statesmen, and all classes of the community,
from the earliest times, being presented indiscriminately. From these
memorials the artist is sketching the portrait of a departed worthy. A literary
gentleman, of a somewhat conventional type, with an open collar, a flowing dressing-gown,
slippers, and general easy looseness of attire, having papers before him,
and various manuscripts and ponderous volumes scattered around, is about, with a
flourish of his quill, to record his impressions of the past; old Father Time, with
his bald crown, and grey beard and spectacles on nose, is leaning on his scythe;
while the grim King of Terrors is grinning by his side, curiously peering over
the shoulders of the unconscious workers, and <span class="locked">suggesting&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The second plate introduces us to the apartment of an elderly antiquary, who,
nightcap on head, is propped up on his couch, with learned tomes littered around
him, trying to peer into the pages, with the light of a candle held in a gilt sconce.
The chamber of the invalid is surrounded by trophies and relics, and apparatus
implying a diversity of tastes, and the means of humouring them. Suits of
armour, suits of costume, weapons, busts, ancient plate, musical instruments,
vases, urns, idols, &amp;c., are mixed up with sketches, folios of prints, palettes,
books, architectural instruments, mortars, retorts, chemicals, and other appliances.
A bull-dog is chasing rats, which are invading these richly lumbered domains.
Wine, and a flask of vain 'elixir,' are at the antiquary's elbow; but his candle is
flickering, and he is already sinking into stupefaction, while the grim King of
Terrors,&mdash;to the horrent affright of a cat perched on the invalid's bed,&mdash;has
stealthily stolen into the chamber; and the last unique curiosity, '<em>Death's dart</em>,' is
about to become the property of the semi-conscious collector.</p>

<p>The chase is a stag, the dogs have just run the noble beast down; the hunters
are making alarming efforts to come in 'at the death,' and accordingly they are
piloted by the grim hunter in person, mounted on a skeleton steed, over the edge
of a cliff which they perceive too late. The frightened horses rear and plunge,
and dash themselves and their riders headlong to destruction.</p>

<p>Death, according to another picture, has asserted his supremacy in the
presence of that very exalted personage, a statesman&mdash;whose table, covered
with deeds and bags of money, and whose office, attended by numerous suitors,
bearing heavy contributions, seem to indicate that the owner has not failed to
provide for himself. The portrait of Midas tops the book-case. A footman is
pouring out a glass of wine for the great man's refreshment, when the Universal
Ruler, the 'King of Terrors,' who in this instance, out of respect possibly to the
object of his call, has assumed his crown&mdash;is peering forth on the pair from
behind a screen; the ghastly summons has driven the colour from the cheeks
of his victim, and drawn the power from his limbs.</p>

<p>The story of Tom Higgins is instructive. He began life as a bricklayer's lad,
rose gradually, by care and industry, to a position of influence, and then turned
his means to account.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_322" id="Page_ii_322">[322]</a></span></p>
<p>After a life devoted to various building schemes and other speculations,
whereby Tom Higgins has grown into a man of great estate, he is persuaded to
become a squire, and to retire to the country, where his new position and state
of being fail to afford him the gratification he had anticipated, and he sighs for
the simple joys of his early days. Coombe's easy verses best describe the artist's
picture, in which the end of wealth and consequence is graphically set forth,
when Death finally drops in and discovers a passive and not unwilling victim in
Tom Higgins.</p>

<p>The good ship is sunk in the deep; all is lost; a few fragments of a longboat
are thrown upon the beach; the coast is rocky and inaccessible; two exhausted
and starving mariners, the remnant of the crew, are the sole survivors, and they
have only escaped the dangers of the deep to face a more lingering fate from
exposure and want. They are cast down without strength to assist themselves,
or encouragement to prolong their miserable existence. Seated on a rock before
them, confronting their blank, hopeless, starved faces, sits the grim foe, from
whose clutches by sea they have barely escaped. Death in this case is merciful,
for he is welcomed as the deliverer. Cries Joe:</p>

<p>Death is shown, in another plate, as the advocate of peace. It is night, and
roysterers are staggering home, assisted by friends, or plundered by the harpies
of darkness, according to their fortune. The watch is calling the hour, when
good souls should sleep in peace. A fury of an old wife, kicking, fuming, and
tearing, is considerately taken in hand by Death, the most effective tranquillising
agent; her husband is bowing and lighting his reviling spouse, and her trusty
keeper, to the door, while she is vainly screaming for the assistance of the watch.
Her departure is viewed with rejoicing.</p>

<p>A well-to-do gourmand has taken his place at a plentifully supplied table,
whereon is spread all kinds of fare; attendants are ministering to his wants, and
a handsome and elegantly dressed female is at his side; the arch-jester, Death,
has suddenly dropped into a vacant arm-chair at the festive board; joints are
scattered, plates are thrown down, the founder of the feast is starting forward in
consternation; a male cook, and serving maids, bringing in fresh dishes, are losing
their grasp of delicacies which will never, as it now appears, regale the gluttony
of their master. The foot of the ghastly skeleton has touched an over-fed
spaniel, and the dog lies stiff. Death is politely handing forth his hourglass
like a goblet, wherein to pledge his host, and enjoying a cruel pleasantry at the
expense of the master of the house.</p>

<p>A party of farm labourers, wearing bunches of ribands in their caps, are being
recruited for the wars; they are led by a drummer, with whose steps they are
clumsily attempting to keep time. One fine, tall, healthy-looking young fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_325" id="Page_ii_325">[325]</a></span>
is taking leave of his sweetheart; his father, mother, and the rest of his family
and friends, grouped around&mdash;down to a grotesque-looking dog&mdash;are plunged
into grief at his departure. Death, who is wearing a plumed hat, a jaunty cloak,
and who carries his dart like a halbert, is clutching the shoulder of the recruit,
and hurrying forward his legions; the universal captain is reminding his followers
of the everlasting burden&mdash;<em>Death</em> and <em>Glory</em>.</p>

<p>Death, with an air of awful gallantry, wearing a gay cap, rakishly set on one side
of his grim bare skull, with his dart put up guitar-wise, and laying a bony hand
on the part of his structure where his heart should be, has arrived, unannounced,
with a lantern to offer the courtesies of his escort to a large gathering of elderly
spinsters&mdash;a 'tabby party' of weird and wizened-looking ancient anatomies&mdash;who
are met for the joint distractions of scandal and gambling. The cards, the
stakes, and the play-table are capsized; a fat footman is gazing with wonder at
the guest last arrived, but the old maids are sensible of the nature of his attentions,
and they are fluttering about in consternation and terror, as to whose
turn has come. Death, it seems, is making a jest of offering what these frozen

<p>Apothecaries' Hall, it might reasonably be hinted by the satirists, was a likely
spot for Death's visitations. In Rowlandson's print we find the grim foe in the
full exercise of his privileges, pounding away with fatal energy. An apothecary
is dispensing various noxious drugs to a considerable crowd of patients, who are
disfigured by various sufferings. They will not be kept waiting long apparently,
for behind a curtain, Death, grinning at himself with a satisfied air in a mirror,
and surrounded by the seeds of mortality, is grinding slow poisons with a will;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_326" id="Page_ii_326">[326]</a></span>

somewhat horrified to find one of his best and most unwieldy customers carried
off by his enraged and scolding wife, for whose assistance Death has himself
brought a wheelbarrow in which to cart away her incapable spouse, and in reply
to the railings of the vixen the grim death's-head is comically wagging his nether

<p>A wealthy old dotard, already half in the grave, has committed the last supreme
folly of decrepitude, and married a young, beautiful, and blooming maid, whose
troth and affections are plighted in advance to a more suitable but less prosperous
suitor. The artist has drawn the enjoyments of the honeymoon; the imbecile
and antiquated 'happy man,' nightcap on head, is plunged in an invalid chair;
a well-stuffed cushion gives ease to his gouty extremities; a table at his side is
spread with a costly dessert service. The palsied hands of the venerable idiot
are vainly striving to steady a goblet for a bumper; the eager toper does not
distinguish the hand which is filling his last glass. The grim skeleton, Death,
stooping over a screen, is supplying the final dose from his own fatal decanter.
The blushing fair, who has been trying to soothe the gouty torments of her
superannuated spouse with music and poetry, is awakened to the sound of a
window opening at her back, her name is pronounced; 'tis the gallant and
dashing young officer, the man of her choice. Nothing abashed, and without
disturbing her attitude beside the invalid, or turning her head, her rounded arm
and taper hand are leant over the casement by way of encouragement to her
lover, who is availing himself of the opportunity and is embracing her fingers.</p>

<p>In this picture the artist has been at the pains to illustrate, without travesty, the
end of a good man, stretched stiff on his last couch. By the side of his bed
kneel various members of his family, plunged into the deepest affliction; at the
head of the bed stands a benevolent-visaged pastor of the church, who has
evidently just administered the last consolations of religion to the departed.
The burlesque element, which does not interfere with the main group of the
sketch, is settled on the action of Death, who, emblematic as usual, is thrusting
before him an evil-looking and overfed quackish practitioner, the extortionate
physician, who has boldly declared 'he has no time for praying, but demands his
honorarium.' The arch foe has fixed his unrelaxing grip upon the shoulder of
Doctor Bolus, who it may be presumed has received his last fee.</p>

who has accompanied the gout-ridden old judge, certain designs, groups of
cupids, and the young couple have seemingly established a very agreeable

<p>The learned schoolmaster, whose years have reached a respectable longevity, is
surprised in the midst of his tasks, while training the minds of the youths
around him, to discover the grim skeleton Death, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mors pulsat</i>, concerning whose
approach he is well stored with classic instances, seated astride of the terrestrial
globe, to the consternation of the scared and flying scholars. The well-read
pedagogue is inclined to give his visitor a lesson from Horace in good manners.</p>

<p>The pale spectre proceeds to remind his charge of the prolonged allowance of

proved too short to allow him to complete the legacy of learning it was his fond
ambition to leave behind him.</p>

<p>The doctor, who seems a kindly preceptor, and one whose self-composure it

his pupils.</p>

<p>A dashing belle, of majestic presence&mdash;according to Rowlandson's design&mdash;is
standing before a toilette table which is elegantly fitted; her costume is just
completed, and her tire-woman is holding a light wrapper, when, in spite of the
exertions made by a duenna to restrain his brusque invasion, an unexpected
intruder is gliding into the handsome chamber. Bowing with the extreme of
mock politeness, Death has come as cavalier to escort the lady, who was preparing
for a masquerade; his hourglass and dart are slung by his side, he sports
a fashionable powdered wig, with a solitaire, a red coat, a cocked hat, dandified
pumps, and a frill, which he is fingering with the air of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit ma&icirc;tre</i>. According
to Coombe's verses, we learn that Flavia, a young lady of <em>ton</em>, whose sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_332" id="Page_ii_332">[332]</a></span>

<p>Old Time, armed with his scythe, is driving his mortuary cart through a village;
the horse is a mere skeleton, but the vehicle is heavily loaded, humanity is
heaped up like carcases of no account, in fact the melancholy receptacle is as
full as it will hold, and the wheel is passing over the neck of a frightened cur.
Death is acting as collector, and has picked up one of the plagues of the village,
a troublesome old man, who is kicking, fighting, and protesting against the
violent illegality of Death's treatment in throwing his lot amongst the defunct.
Stern Time, on the box, is turning round to remonstrate with his assistant.</p>

<p>A prosperous quack practitioner, meditating over his specific <em>sovereign pill to
cure all ills</em>, is riding gravely through the streets of a picturesque country town.
As his hack is passing Screwtight the undertaker's window, that worthy is thrown
into consternation, for he recognises, immovably perched behind the cogitating

<p>A masked ball is represented at its height, gaily attended, and held in the
Pantheon or some similar building. A dance is proceeding; the most diversified
scenes meet the eye on all sides, and Rowlandson has given full play to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_334" id="Page_ii_334">[334]</a></span>
his humorous inventive faculties. In the front of the picture the crowd of merrymakers,
all unthinking and unprepared, are horrified to discover a new turn
abruptly given to the travesty; the tall figure of Death has suddenly cast away
his disguising domino, and holding aside a demoniac mask, is revealing to the
terrified spectators the actual figure of the skeleton-destroyer, armed with his
dart, and in grim earnest to strike. Harlequins, nuns, monks, devils, Turks,
toxopholites, bacchantes, jockeys, Punch, Falstaff, Jupiter, Ophelia, Friar Tuck,
watchmen, magicians, fair enchantresses and Circassians, archbishops, Roman
heroes, and Grand Signiors&mdash;characters in vogue in Rowlandson's day&mdash;are
thrown down pell-mell and trampling one over the other in their eagerness
to get as far away as possible from this unwelcome and awful addition to the
excitement of the revelry; this ghastly joker who with unequivocal reality is
threatening to extinguish their gaieties for ever.</p>

<p>Two prize-fighters have met on Epsom Downs to decide the championship of
the 'Ring,' with umpires, bottle-holders, and all the paraphernalia of the 'fancy.'
In the artist's picture one of the combatants has received a fatal blow, and he is
stretched lifeless on the turf. The grim figure of Death, the bony personification
which permeates the series, has suddenly joined the sport, and he is squaring
up to the scared victor in a scientific and confident attitude; the horrified
champion is unconsciously raising his strong arms to guard himself against this
new opponent, though justly disinclined to continue such an unequal contest.
Impressed by the fatal ending of the man he has beaten the winner has
conscientiously registered a vow, on the spur of the moment, 'to never fight again.'</p>

<p>A party of the fashionably curious are carrying their taste for sight-seeing down
into the catacombs, and the fragments of decaying humanity are lighted up for
their ghastly entertainment. In the instance designed by Rowlandson the
visitors are lost in horror at the spectacle of the grinning human skulls arranged
in trim arcades; they do not notice the person of their conductor, who is more
fearful to look upon than the relics around. Death himself, dart in hand, is
condescending to act as showman to the gallery of his own furnishing; the torch
he holds is whirled aloft in his grisly left arm, in an instant it will be flung into
a well of water, which the holiday-makers have not distinguished; darkness must
succeed, and many of the spectators may follow the flambeau or lose their way
in terror-striking and fearful labyrinths which extend for leagues under the city.</p>

<p>Seated snugly in the hall-porter's easy-chair before the handsome mantel and
cheerful fire in the marble-paved hall of a nobleman's mansion, with its statues
and embellishments telling of ease, taste, and profusion, is our old friend the
grim hero of the series. He is waiting quite tranquilly, impatience is foreign to
his impassive temperament; his hourglass is on the ground at his side; his dart
is held negligently, but in readiness; a nocturnal bird is hovering suggestively
over his fleshless head; he has supplanted the night-porter, and is probably
sitting there attending the return of the unprepared owner of these rich surroundings.
Some sound has alarmed the servants; the butler has stolen down
in his nightcap, armed with sword and pistol; he is collapsed with terror, and
his defences are dropping from his hand on making the discovery that Death has
established himself in the hall; and the fat cook, who is also paralysed with
horror, has taken a false step, and is falling giddily down the staircase, whence
her head will come in violent contact with the marble floor; and Death without
turning in his seat may confidently count upon one victim in advance.</p>

<p>A pantomimic scene is transpiring; according to the artist's picture, it is the very
last place where Death's ghastly impersonation could be considered a diverting
addition to the company. The background represents the sea-shore; Columbine,
supported on the arm of Harlequin, is pirouetting and posturing in amorous poses;
the other personages of the mimic theatre are thrown into actions which are
entirely unpremeditated, while their countenances wear expressions which supply
ghastly contrasts to their motley. Death once more has intruded his bony person
on the stage, the inevitable dart is held slily behind him, and in the painted and
terror-stricken faces of Pierrot and Pantaloon the tale-telling hourglass is held
up, the sand has run through, and the mummers must away hence. The stage
wizard is stretched at length on his back, and his wonder-working magic sword is
mere lath and tinsel before the weapon of this grim supernatural actor, who has
come, unengaged, to give a new turn to the show.</p>

<p>The artist has pictured a race-course; in the distance the grand stand, a group
of tents, and crowds of equestrians and equipages may be distinguished. A file
of race-horses, with their jockeys and trainers, are being walked up to the starting
point. A crowd of mounted 'sporting gents,' the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&eacute;lite</i> of the patrons of the turf, are
assembled round the 'betting post,' shouting the odds and eagerly making their
engagements before the approaching start. Nearer the spectator is displayed
some of the fun of the course, which never failed to strike Rowlandson's eye. An
old dame has a table and an arrow, at which sundry juvenile rustics are gambling
for cakes, and a Jew pedlar is tossing with two sportive urchins for nuts. The
<em>Dead Heat</em> referred to in Coombe's lines is shown in the person of an anxious
country squire, who, afraid of arriving at the betting post too late to speculate, is
pushing his horse along madly to arrive in time, without noticing a skeleton
steed, neck and neck with his own, whose jockey is the inevitable skeleton, <em>Mors</em>,
wearing a gay cap and feather, and turning his dart to account as a riding-whip.</p>

<p>The scene represents one of the parks, the waters are frozen over and crowded
with pleasure-seekers of both sexes indulging their amusement in the teeth of
danger&mdash;nay, as it appears in the picture, in the very jaws of death. The
skeleton foe is taking his pastime amongst the crowd, and combining relaxation
with business. The ice is suddenly giving way in all directions, and the skaters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_339" id="Page_ii_339">[339]</a></span>
are tripped up by the grim evolutionist. They are falling headlong into the
water, fatal casualties are occurring on all sides, and the distant crowds, who are
scrambling away incontinently since the arch-enemy has volunteered to share
their pastime, are coming into violent collision, and falling on the ice, breaking
their limbs or suffering fatal concussions.</p>

<p>Nowhere could Death's presence be more suitably manifested than on the field
of honour; and, as the artist has pictured the situation, the parties are met to
settle some trifling dispute; seconds and surgeons are naturally in attendance.
Death is promptly dashing in and dragging off a stout combatant in the prime of
life, who, having just received his quietus, is caught in the arms of the omniscient
and universal antagonist before his falling body can touch his mother earth.</p>

<span class="i0">Though I may yield my forfeit breath,<br /></span>

<p>The artist, with that talent which distinguished him above his contemporaries,
has concluded the first volume of the <cite>Dance of Death</cite> with a nobler design; an
occasion is presented with deeper purpose wherein Death is shorn of the
majesty of terror. A venerable bishop, seated in a handsome Gothic apartment
of the episcopal palace, with the Book of Life open before him, and his chaplain
in attendance, is receiving an abrupt visitation from the ghastly spectre. The
difficulty of frightening the reverend victim, whose mind seems well prepared for
the end, however premature, has made Death put himself somewhat out of the
way to appear sensationally startling; his grim humour seems to have been laid
aside for once, and he is weakly seeking effect in a theatrical pose, striking a
stagey attitude, poising his weapon, and holding on high his warning hourglass.
The whole impression is admirably conveyed. The Destroyer's posture is pretentious
without being imposing; he has missed his point; this bombastical
terrorism has nothing of the terrific left in it, and Death looks somewhat disappointed
on failing to produce more consternation. The bishop is calmly receiving
his turbulent visitor, with an air which seems to demand, without perturbation:
'O Death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?'</p>

<p>Upon a rock-bound shore, whose jagged boulders come down to the deep,
dashes a troubled sea, the waters of which are settling down after a tempest.
Upon the foam floats the form of a drowned man; above is seen the figure of a
female, forlorn and reckless, who has come to meet her future husband, and finds
only his corpse&mdash;his life lost in a valiant effort to succour a sinking fellow-creature
from a wreck.</p>

<p>The verses intended to illustrate this picture of Death's visitations contain an
argument between three friends on the best means of regulating their lives; the
artist has worked out this theory in his plate. One member of the party assembled,
a stout florid old gentleman, declares his golden rule in life has been to
please himself, so he and his daughter are illustrating his text by drinking full
bumpers of champagne; beside him, sipping his thimblefuls of sherry, is another
theorist, who has passed his days in moderate indulgences. In an invalid chair
beside the fire sits their host, a vaporous hypochondriac, who has passed his
existence in humouring imaginary ills on a diet of sago and doctor's stuff. His
nurse is preparing a saucepan of gruel, which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mortis Imago</i>, as his convivial
friend has christened him, is preferring to more exhilarating beverages. Death
has stepped in and settled the question as to which of these old schoolfellows
shall last the longest; he has placed his bony hand on the shoulder of the great
patron of doctors, and before departing with his 'meagre meal' he is giving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_341" id="Page_ii_341">[341]</a></span>
friends, who are allowed to survive for the time being, this piece of gratuitous
advice if they would put off his visits as long as possible:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div></div>

<p>This picture may be designated a warning to fashionable mothers. A fine infant
has been 'put out to nurse;' it is evident that the child would have been better
at home. The 'foster mother' is a coarse sloven, and has neglected her charge
for her self-indulgence. The natural parent, a handsome young woman, dressed
in the height of the mode, and accompanied by friends of quality, has yielded to
a sudden impulse to pay a visit to her offspring. The door of the cottage is
opened, and this is what meets the horrified eyes of the party. The nurse sunk
in a drunken sleep, her head on a cushion, another cushion at her feet, a flagon
of spirits at her elbow and a glass in her hand, and a starved cat on her chair;
the infant's food upset on the floor, the apartment neglected, a clothes-line and
damp linen stretched over the infant's head, and Death sitting by, grotesquely
rocking the cradle, and singing his mortal lullaby.</p>

<p>The astronomer, who from his surroundings would also seem a student of miscellaneous
sciences, is seated in his observatory, deep in the contemplation of the
planets. Grim Death has called to summon the 'learned Senex' hence, and he
is playing his victim a final prank.</p>

<p>Death, in this picture, has rather a hard tussle for it. His friends, the learned
physicians, who are pocketing their fees, and turning their backs on their late
patient, are hurrying away. Death, with a great show of force, has seized his
victim, still in the pride of manhood, by the dressing-gown, and is seeking to
drag him from the frantic embraces of those to whom his life is dear. The
father and mother are remonstrating with this merciless abductor; the blooming
wife and infants of the unfortunate are cast down in despair; his sisters have
seized him boldly round the waist, and, one behind the other, are making a
sturdy stand against the fatal messenger; the servants and all the inmates of the
noble mansion have rushed out, and are endeavouring by their entreaties, or by a
show of resistance, to stay the steps of the tyrant.</p>

<p>But on arriving at a low bridge, which spans a torrent, the blood horses become

are sent over the narrow bridge, the tall curricle is capsized, and eternity is
instantly opened to the careless pleasure-seekers.</p>

<p>Gaffer Goodman is a selfish sybarite, who has secured a charming rustic maiden
for his wife, as being a proceeding more economical than engaging a nurse. The
gaffer, whose existence is centred on creature comforts, is seated in his huge
easy-chair, under a row of goodly hams, a provision for the future, before his
Brobdingnagian fireplace, with a cosy nightcap, dressing-gown, and slippers for
ease, meditating over the good things preparing for dinner, his beer jug ready to
hand and warming, sunk in the tranquil enjoyment of his pipe. Another smoker
has, unperceived by the gaffer, planted himself by his side, burlesquing his enjoyment,
and timing his whiffs to the final puff. The neat and pretty wife,
sacrificed to the selfishness of the old yeoman, is cheerfully spinning her flax at
the open window, leaning through which the artist has introduced a well-favoured
youth, her late sweetheart, discarded by necessity, but soon to be consoled, as
the lady is assuring the lad of her heart.</p>

<span class="i0">O the unconscionable brute!<br /></span>

<p>The plate represents a pretty, trimly kept garden, belonging to a mansion of
some pretensions. A group of young marauders have been stripping the orchard.
They are suddenly scared by the apparition of the gardener, whose person is
disclosed over a bush beside his greenhouses, where, gun in hand, he has been
lying in ambush, to teach his troublesome tormentors a lesson. Some of the
marauders have gained the wall, and are dragging up their comrades. Others
are following, loaded with well-filled bags of plunder; a bigger lad is seized in
the rear by the gardener's dog. The man has no deadly intentions, he merely
wishes to frighten the urchins as a warning; but the grim figure is lurking undiscovered
by his side; the musket is discharged, and to the affright of the
custodian of the fruit, a youth falls lifeless to the ground. 'Twas not his aim
which had wrought this mischief; the whole affair was pre-arranged by his unperceived
companion, with the most plausible motives, as Death himself confesses.</p>

<p>The sea is in a tempest, and the wrecks of two good ships are battling with the
foaming waters. A number of unfortunate creatures are endeavouring to escape
in a longboat, pulled by the rowers with the vigour of despair; but the struggle
for life is cut short; grim Death has taken his place in the stern, he is exultingly
flourishing Time's hourglass before the horrified survivors, and wilfully steering
the bark to destruction; the head of the boat is dipping beneath the waves, and
a watery grave completes Death's handiwork.</p>

<p>The picture represents a general scene of downfall. A stout clergyman has
obstinately insisted on his right to attend to his own timepiece over the chimney-glass.
His fat body has lost its balance, the steps are overturned, the breakfast
table and its equipage are brought to ruin; the shock, aided by the sly hand
of Death in ambush, has upset his portly wife in her arm-chair, and a general
destruction is hinted of persons and property alike.</p>

<p>In this plate we are introduced to a scene of extensive domestic felicity; at a
breakfast-table is seated the father of a numerous family, surrounded by fourteen
pledges of conjugal affection; another child is in a nurse's arms, and in the
apartment beyond may be perceived the worthy and prolific partner of his joys,
who has lately presented her husband with their sixteenth infant. Death proposes
to take one or two of these children under his charge, but the good father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_345" id="Page_ii_345">[345]</a></span>
will not hear of it. 'Well then, let it be the infant,' proposes the greedy fiend.
'No, 'twould break the mother's heart!' 'Whom shall I strike then?' Death
demands. The benevolent parent can only suggest 'the nurse.'</p>

<p>Death's bony person is half thrust through his portals&mdash;which lead to the grave&mdash;as
he has been disturbed by a boisterous summons thundered at his gate. He
seems quite shocked at the importunities of a crowd of unfortunates who are
clamorous in their demands for instant admittance to the unknown realms.
Madmen, the extremely aged, the gouty, the bereaved, those afflicted with
poverty, disease, scolding wives, the hungering, cripples, forsaken ones, and
a multitude of various sufferers to whom the buffets of life have proved
insupportable, are supplicating refuge from an unkindly world.</p>

brace of flaming torches, and is bent on doing all the mischief within his power.
A farmhouse is the object of his destructiveness; the cattle are escaping, and the
family, disturbed from their slumbers by fire, are huddled together with such
articles as could be secured in a hurried flight when their own lives were endangered.
The unfortunate pigs may count on being roasted, as nothing can

bonds, notes, and a bag of money; his body is propped up by a 'book of
interest,' and he has died, without the ease of a bed, on a mattress placed on the
floor of his strong room. His iron boxes and money chests are opened by Death,
who is leading the miser's delighted heirs into the treasure-chamber, where the
bags of wealth, heaps of coin, and files of securities have banished all remembrance
of the miserable corpse, lately the self-denying hoarder of these superfluous
riches.</p>

<p>A coach-and-four, driven by two postilions, is speeding off to Scotland; it contains
a fair ward, and a captain, her abductor. This hopeful pair are eloping to
Gretna Green; the ward is escaping from the house of her old guardian, who
had a desire to marry her himself for her wealth; the baffled and avaricious
tyrant is riding his hardest to overtake the fugitives, who are threatening him
with pistols held out of either window. Death, mounted on a skeleton steed, is
riding step for step with the pursuer, whose horse will presently stumble, the
chase will be over, and the greedy guardian's schemes will be abruptly brought
to an end.</p>

<p>The heroine of this adventure is an heiress who is loved by a certain lord, but in
spite of the daughter's inclinations and the quality of the suitor, the crabbed
father will neither part with his child nor his wealth while he retains his place in
life. This impediment is removed in the picture. While the unreasonable parent
is hobbling on his crutches into the entrance of a mausoleum, the door of which
Death is assiduous to open for the reception of his expected visitor, the happy
couple, overjoyed, are walking, locked in a tender embrace, to his lordship's

<p>Another fair heiress forms the subject of this fresh whim of Death's fancy. The
lady is what the author terms a 'philosopher in love,' and she cannot decide to
quit her state of independence. A conclave of her suitors are assembled to argue
the marriage question, and, by the maiden's wish, to allow her a chance of judging
by comparison. The array of aspirants is comprehensive; there is a colonel, a
lawyer, a parson, a doctor, a quaker, and a baronet. Each pretender to her
hand and fortune in turn argues the inducements he has to plead; this done, it
rests with the lady to reply to the respective arguments and examine their
motives. While logically disposing of all their fine persuasions, the intractable
fair is claimed by a suitor who will take no denial. The reasoning of the arch-enemy
is unanswerable:&mdash;</p>

<p>A scene of gross intoxication is proceeding. A convivial company is assembled;
the effort of every individual's ambition is apparently the downfall of his neighbour
by successive toasts; bowl succeeds bowl, and half the assembly are <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de
combat</i>. A new chairman has, uninvited, installed himself at the head of the table,
and he is making the liquor circulate with such hearty goodwill that the topers
have received him, in spite of his repellant exterior, as one of themselves. Death
has ordered in fresh supplies of steaming punch, which he is ladling out to the
fascinated tipplers; it is the final toast, and no one dares refuse to pledge it.
'One bumper more,' and the jovial meeting will be dissolved for ever.</p>

<p>The picture introduces us to the gate of Vauxhall Gardens; the light-hearted
visitors are quitting the entertainment. The wise virgins are carefully wrapped
up with cloaks, hoods, scarves, and muffs, and duly lighted home by cautious
guardians carrying lanterns. In the foreground the foolish revellers are portrayed.
They have left the heated dancing room in their light attire; a couple
of giddy maidens, who are too careless to wait for their coach, are skipping off
into the damp and chilling atmosphere without a wrapper, their thin dresses
blowing in the wind, and running home under the escort of a gallant major.
Death, with a jaunty cap on his head, and muffled in a cloak which disguises
his ghostly frame, is dancing before, a very 'will-o'-the-wisp,' dangling about a
flickering lantern, a dangerous guide whom they fail to recognise.</p>

<p>A busy lawyer, hastening away from Westminster Hall, where he has been
exercising his lungs, has jumped into a chariot without noticing the driver on the
box-seat. In this case Death is officiating as charioteer; he is whipping his
horses with a vengeance. The serjeant's coach is endangering the life of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_349" id="Page_ii_349">[349]</a></span>
brother counsel, a dog is running between the frightened barrister's legs, and his
end seems imminent. Death has chosen to wreck the carriage over a pile of
stones and a heavily-loaded wheelbarrow which the paviours have left in the
course of road-mending. The serjeant, brief in hand, is thrusting his angry face
through the front of the capsizing vehicle, vehemently threatening penalties and

<p>In this instance we are introduced to the 'chamber of mystery' of a pretended
fortune-teller. The empiric seer is surrounded by the paraphernalia of his profession;
a crocodile is suspended to the ceiling, above a mystic string of orbs,
and the globes have an uncanny black cat perched thereon, a witch at the least.
Two credulous ladies of fashion have called to consult the pretentious impostor,
who rejoices in the fur cap, flowing robes, long beard, and divining rod of a
magician; a book of nativities is open before him:&mdash;'To me all fates, all fortunes
known;' to which Death retorts, in hollow voice: 'Vain boaster, tell your own.' A
greater conjuror is present concealed behind Merlin's seat; a jerk, and the wizard
is no longer above deception; he is overturned, his neck is broken amidst the
wreck of his mummeries scattered around.</p>

<p>The evil of permitting lotteries, which were still in existence and flourishing at
the time this plate was projected, is set forth in a graphic design. A crowd of
needy adventurers have hurried to the lottery office, eager to know if fortune
has assigned them lucky numbers. Jews, misers, and all sorts of gamblers, including
a mob of hardy rogues who have purloined their employers' property to
tempt the smiles of the fickle goddess, are darting from the office in dismay.
An unlucky female, who has ventured her all, and even risked the means and
belongings of others on the chance of winning a prize, has come to inquire her
fate. The grim foe has exultingly taken his place among the clerks; he is
holding out two blanks with an air of fiendish malice, and the shock is proving a
deathblow to the unfortunate fair gambler, she is expiring in the office.</p>

<p>Death in this case is still shown interfering with the course of others' business.
The picture represents a debtors' prison; a wife and two daughters have come
to visit an unhappy captive, the head of the family, who is detained by a relentless
creditor. They just arrive in time to see their relative released beyond the
resistance of mortal detainers. The deadly foe has called at the gate, the prisoner
is summoned forth, warders and turnkeys dare not refuse to let him free in such
company. A mortified Shylock and his disappointed lawyer are furiously pointing
to their bonds, and dancing with rage to find their ends defeated by the grim
joker, who is grinning at their manifest discomfiture.</p>

<p>A military Don Juan is the unfortunate hero of this adventure. He loves the
beauteous daughter of a fire-eating superannuated colonel, Full of romantic
gallantry, he has planted a ladder at his mistress's window, and is mounting
nimbly where Cupid invites him, without observing the grim figure which has
hold of his scaling-ladder. The sturdy colonel, awakened by the unaccustomed
and suspicious sounds in his grounds, has fired his evening gun into the darkness,
at most expecting to startle the cats. Death capsizes the ladder, the youthful
lieutenant loses his balance and falls headlong into a pond on the lawn, whence
his body is fished out in the morning, to the surprise of the household.</p>

awaiting the arrival of a hearse and mourning <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cort&eacute;ge</i>,
is the author of the mischief
hobnobbing with his friends and allies. Death and the doctor are blowing a
cloud together in cheerful company, for the parson, the lawyer, and the sexton
are pleased with his society. The undertaker is no less grateful to his useful
patron, and even the distant bell-ringer acknowledges the value of his acquaintanceship.</p>

<p>The funeral of a great and benevolent man is the subject of this cartoon. The
venerable lord of the manor is dead; the stately funeral is setting out with its
doleful attendants from the lordly hall. The coffin, with its emblazoned pall, is
followed by a long train of mourners, whose sorrow is sincere; Death is congenially
employing himself as bearer of the funeral plumes; and in this capacity,
bending under the melancholy feathers, he is taking the lead of the procession.
The tenants and villagers are standing uncovered as the body of their best friend
is borne past; aged and young alike are giving way to unaffected grief, and it is
evident that they regret the loss of a respected and kindly landlord, who has
made himself loved by his neighbours.</p>

<p>The <em>Next Heir</em> forms a pendant to the <em>Good and Great</em>, and exhibits a picture
the contrast of the foregoing. The nephew, a dashing London blade, has succeeded
to the title and the estates. He is supposed to arrive post haste at the
mansion, which is still plunged in mourning for the late owner. The pastor and
the tenants are drawn up to receive their new master. The approach of the
departed lord's successor is filling their faces with dismay. The devil-may-care
'blood' is tearing up to the hall in a tandem, his followers are clothed in deep
black, but beyond this he displays no regard for the dead; his servants are
clashing up on horseback, his huntsman is giving a blast of his horn, his grooms
are shouting 'Tally-ho!' and a pack of hounds are barking on all sides. Death
is acting as postilion, and as this unthinking heir drives up to the entrance-court
his head is caught by the hatchment put up to the late lord, and his mad career
is cut short at the very threshold.</p>

<p>The case of the invalid who forms the principal figure in the present subject
must indeed be a desperate one, since the doctors, after a wordy warfare disputing
over the case of the patient and the proper treatment, have come to blows
in real earnest. Medicine bottles, and all the accessories of a sick chamber, are
thrown to the ground, the table is overturned, wigs are sent flying, and a regular
scrimmage with fisticuffs is taking place. Four practitioners are cuffing one
another in the presence of their victim, with professional energy, and the sick nurse
is cutting in, attacking the shaven crowns indiscriminately with the utensils which
first come to hand. The sufferer is thrown into a mortal fright, but Death has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_352" id="Page_ii_352">[352]</a></span>
very considerately called in to attend to his wants, and his disquietude will soon

<p>A party of ardent arch&aelig;ologists are holding a meeting in the abbey. They have
obtained permission to open a royal grave, and the sexton has performed his
part, and raised the slab of the vault in which the body of a king has reposed
undisturbed for centuries. The coffin is raised, the lid removed, and the corpse,
with its regal trappings, is laid open to their inspection. Full of enthusiasm,
the antiquaries are clustering round the coffin in crowds, eager to get a sight
of the decaying monarch. Nor do they heed the risk they run, for Death,
jealous of this interference with his rights, is prepared to resent their intrusion;
and, mounted on an adjacent tomb, he is about to plunge his dart into the thickest
of the learned throng.</p>

<p>A sumptuous feast is represented: the handsome dining-room is filled with
voracious guests; footmen are waiting on the diners, or attending to side tables;
butlers are drawing corks, course is following course, the cook and his assistant
train are hurrying in with fresh dishes. Among the waiters, undetected, is our
friend the grisly skeleton, who is busying himself with a dish he is conveying to
the table. It is the favourite delicacy of the corpulent host, and he has expressed
a desire for 'just one slice more' of his esteemed dainty. The grim foe is
determined to take the entertainer at his word, and that 'one slice more' will be
his last indulgence.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The sketch in this suggestive plate introduces us to the court-yard of the
<em>Dolphin Inn</em>, a famous posting-house. The life to be found in these coach-yards
was attractive material to our artist, and he has delineated with rare skill
all the bustle and preparation of a departure. The coach is 'braced' up, the
horses are put-to, the guard and his 'helps' are busied in loading luggage on the
roof, and stowing parcels in the boot and under the box-seat. Bills are being
settled, and farewells said by the passengers, who are booked to travel by the
'stage.' Death is assiduously attending to the loading of the coach, and he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_353" id="Page_ii_353">[353]</a></span>
courteously wedging a stout lady through the doorway. It is likely that he will
not quit the travellers yet, but will ride, unobserved, a part of the journey, until,
perhaps, in the night he will contrive some fatal upset, and his evil whim will be
accomplished.</p>

<p>Plate 36. <cite>Time, Death, and Eternity.</cite></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The song now bursts beyond the bounds of time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Immortality concludes the rhyme.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>After tracing Death's farcical pranks through seventy-one plates, in nearly all of
which the mischief projected by the arch-foe is crowned with success, the artist
has thought proper to abandon Death's triumphs and to show the enemy at a
disadvantage. The scene is allegorically set forth in the despair and overthrow
of Time, and the banishment of Death before the Everlasting Angel. The
Spirit of Eternity is blowing the last trump. Time is vainly tearing out his
forelock; his wings are useless; he is cast on his back, the scythe and hourglass
broken, amidst the crumbling monuments around him; pyramids and temples
are melting away; the monuments raised by vain man are dissolving, and Death
has forfeited his fell sovereignty of destruction. The slayer is slain in turn; his
crown has fallen into the abyss, his fatal dart is harmless and snapped asunder,
and he, abashed and disconcerted, is crouching from his doom, and falling
through to the bottomless pit. So much for the pictorial allegory.</p>

<p>We have specially dwelt on the illustration which Rowlandson designed to
finish the first part of the <cite>Dance of Death</cite>, wherein the spectral tyrant is displayed
shorn of his terrors. The artist on occasions could sink the ludicrous and rise to
the sublime.</p>

<p>The author, as we are inclined to believe, was elevated by the subject brought
under his treatment, and, finding the theme congenial to his talents, he exerted
himself to bring out its stronger points. In the last picture which concludes the
series we are still more impressed with the sense of his fitness for the task.
Coombe, when he wrote the concluding verses to this diversified poem, was on
the verge of four score; he had fought the battle of life, and found little glory
and less profit in the struggle. Nature had endowed him with an agreeable
person and sound health, and he was by disposition studious. He had been
the idol of an hour, and (rare chance for a scholar) had found a large sum of
money at his command, and dissipated sufficient wealth to realise to the full
the emptiness of gratifications which depend on mere monetary advantages;
he had been taught the worthlessness of fair-weather friends, the hollowness of
flatterers, and knew the folly of trusting in the great; he had learned other
lessons of life, and could, from his own heart, read many a homily on the deceptiveness
of beauty and the quickly withered flowers of passion. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_354" id="Page_ii_354">[354]</a></span>
incessantly pursued happiness through life; he had been rich, courted, cultivated,
temperate, and a discriminating judge of most things that are counted desirable
in the world; a ripe scholar and a perfect gentleman&mdash;if we may believe contemporary
accounts&mdash;and he found all this led him to disappointment and the
confinement of a debtor's prison.</p>

</div>

<p><cite>The Family Picture.</cite>&mdash;'My wife and daughters, happening to return a visit to
neighbour Flamborough's, found that family had lately got their pictures drawn by a
limner who travelled the country and took likenesses for fifteen shillings a head.
As this family and ours had long a sort of rivalry in point of taste, our spirit took
the alarm at this stolen march upon us; and notwithstanding all I could say, and
I said much, it was resolved that we should have our pictures done too. Having,
therefore, engaged the limner&mdash;for what else could I do?&mdash;our next deliberation
was to show the superiority of our taste in the attitudes. As for our neighbour's
family, there were seven of them, and they were drawn with seven oranges, a
thing quite out of taste&mdash;no variety in life, no composition in the world. We
desired to have something in a brighter style; and after many debates at length
came to a unanimous resolution of being drawn together in one large historical
family piece. This would be cheaper, since one frame would serve for all, and
it would be infinitely more genteel, for all families of any taste were now drawn
in the same manner. As we did not immediately recollect an historical subject
to hit us we were contented each with being drawn as independent historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_358" id="Page_ii_358">[358]</a></span>
figures. My wife desired to be represented as Venus, and the painter was
desired not to be too frugal of his diamonds in her stomacher and hair. Her
two little ones were to be as Cupids by her side; while I, in my gown and band,
was to present her with my books on the Whistonian controversy. Olivia would
be drawn as an Amazon, sitting on a bank of flowers, dressed in a green joseph,
richly laced with gold, and a whip in her hand. Sophia was to be a shepherdess,
with as many sheep as the painter could put in for nothing; and Moses was to
be dressed out with a hat and white feather. Our taste so much pleased the
Squire that he insisted on being put in as one of the family, in the character of
Alexander the Great, at Olivia's feet. This was considered by us all as an indication
of his desire to be introduced into the family; nor could we refuse his
request. The painter was therefore set to work; and as he wrought with assiduity
and expedition, in less than four days the whole was completed. The
piece was large, and it must be owned he did not spare his colours, for which my
wife gave him great encomiums. We were all perfectly satisfied with his performance;
but an unfortunate circumstance had not occurred till the picture was
finished, which now struck us with dismay. It was so very large that we had no
place in the house to fix it. How we all came to disregard so material a point
is inconceivable; but certain it is we had been all greatly remiss. The picture,
therefore, instead of gratifying our vanity, as we hoped, leaned in a most mortifying
manner against the kitchen wall, where the canvas was stretched and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_359" id="Page_ii_359">[359]</a></span>
painted, much too large to be got through any of the doors, and the jest of all
our neighbours. One compared it to Robinson Crusoe's longboat, too large to
be removed; another thought it more resembled a reel in a bottle; some wondered
how it could be got out, but still more were amazed how it got in.'</p>

<p>'<em>Advertisement.</em>&mdash;The eight monthly numbers to which this work was limited
being completed, it is presented to the public in an accumulated volume. Though
an acquaintance has taken place between the artist and the writer, the same
principle has in a great degree, if not altogether, predominated in the originality
of the designs and attendant illustrations of them as produced the <cite>Tour of
Doctor Syntax</cite> and the <cite>Dance of Death</cite>.'</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Illustrations.</span>

<p>Frontispiece.&mdash;<cite>The Dance of Life</cite>; a panoramic scroll, on which Rowlandson's
pictures which illustrate the series are represented in miniature. Father Time, with
his accessories of scythe, hourglass, and globe, is acting as showman and pointing
out the subjects of the work to a group of spectators, whose faces and attitudes
are expressive of the admiration and interest which the pictorial history is exciting.</p>

<p>Titlepage.&mdash;The vignette of a lightly touched and gracefully drawn female
dancing figure, with a scarf airily floating from her shoulders. The nymph is
encircled by a ring of pretty children, hand in hand, who are dancing round her;

<h2><a name="d1818" id="d1818"></a>1818.</h2>


<p><i>January 20, 1818.</i> <cite>The Last Jig, or Adieu to Old England.</cite> Published by
T. Tegg.</p>

<p>1818. <cite>Wild Irish, or Paddy from Cork, with his coat buttoned behind.</cite> Designed,
etched, and published by T. Rowlandson, 1 James Street, Adelphi.
Republished 1818.&mdash;One of the series published by the artist, to the finish,
execution, and colouring of which he devoted extra care. The scene pictures a
haymaking festivity. Paddy from Cork, hayfork in hand, has literally turned
his coat hind part before; he is dancing in company with another swain, who
is holding a whisky-jug, and a fellow Patlander, fiddling and capering for very
life, beside two buxom lasses, who are flourishing hayrakes and throwing themselves
into the most attractive attitudes. Groups suggestive of both rural
felicity and a terrific combat in combination are figured in the distance, as the
true Patland ideal of finishing a day's pleasure.</p>

<p>1818(?). <cite>Doncaster Fair, or the Industrious Yorkshire Bites.</cite> Designed,
etched, and published by T. Rowlandson, 1 James Street, Adelphi.&mdash;The
principal figure in the foreground group is a buxom but hardly gentle keeperess
of a <em>knock-'em-down</em> stand. The lady, clad in a soldier's old jacket, with ragged
skirts and defective hose, is holding in one arm an instalment of sticks&mdash;'three
throws a penny'&mdash;and is demanding her fee, a trifle boisterously, from a smock-clad
yokel, who is diving into his short-clothes pocket for the coppers which do
not appear to be forthcoming. Other rustics are taking their pastime at the
same amusement, and one, in perplexity, is scratching his head. The bustle of
a country fair is set forth in the distance; there is the usual display of booths
and mountebanks, countrymen on horseback, love-making in carts, stalls, and
struggling groups of sightseers.</p>

<p><i>May 9, 1819.</i> <cite>A Rough Sketch of the Times, as delineated by Sir Francis
Burdett.</cite> Published by T. Tegg (15).&mdash;Sir Francis Burdett is shown standing
in the centre of the picture, a scarf thrown over his shoulders is marked <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magna
Charta</i> and <em>Bills of Rights</em>; he holds the Genius of <em>Honour</em> and <em>Integrity</em>
firmly clasped by the hand, and, pointing to <em>The Monster of Corruption</em>, observes:
'Look here upon this picture, and on this, and then judge for yourselves.'
The persons of both patriot and monster are mapped out with inscriptions, their
several parts being typically labelled: '<em>The Genius of Honour</em> rejoices in a sound
mind;' 'An eye ever watchful to the welfare of his fellow-citizens;' 'A tongue
that never belied a good heart;' 'An upright breast and an honest heart;' 'A
shoulder that never shrinks in trouble;' 'A plain liver and a lover of peace and
plenty;' 'Pockets ever open to the necessities of fellow-creatures;' 'A knee
to religion;' 'Legs ever steady in his country's cause;' and 'Feet to crush
tyranny;' while in his 'Hand of Justice' is displayed a declaration of these
principles: 'A staunch supporter of the Bill of Rights; an advocate for a fair
representation of the people, and an enemy to bribery and corruption.' The
attributes of the corrupt candidate are less flattering. The head of the monster
is marked 'Professions and promises;' his nose has 'a scent for Interest;' his
huge eye is devoted to Interest, and his mouth to Guile; he bears the 'Collar of
Corruption;' 'a cringing soul,' 'a pampered appetite;' 'a rotten borough,' and
'secret service money' mark his trunk; his 'arms of power' end in 'hands of
extortion,' which grasp 'pensions, reversions, perquisites of office, and bags of
bribery;' he is supported on 'legs of luxury and feet of connivance.'</p>

1 James Street, Adelphi.&mdash;Sir Humphrey Davy is exhibiting experiments at the
Royal Institution before a highly respectable audience of visitors and members
of both sexes. An antiquated fogey, who has evidently no opinion of the
brilliant young lecturer, is snarling at the demonstrations. A treatise of the
period, <cite>Accum's Lectures</cite>, is shown in his coat-pocket.</p>

as a companion to the New Picture of London. Consisting of fifty-four plates,

<p>'<em>Advertisement.</em>&mdash;The British public must be already acquainted with
numerous productions from the inimitable pencil of Mr. Rowlandson, who has
particularly distinguished himself in this department.</p>

<p>'There is so much truth and genuine feeling in his delineations of human
character, that no one can inspect the present collection without admiring his
masterly style of drawing and admitting his just claim to originality.</p>

<p>'The great variety of countenance, expression and situation, evince an active
and lively feeling, which he has so happily infused into the drawings, as to divest
them of that broad caricature which is too conspicuous in the works of those
artists who have followed his manner. Indeed, we may venture to assert that,
since the time of Hogarth, no artist has appeared in this country who could be
considered his superior, or even his equal.'</p>

<h2><a name="d1821" id="d1821"></a>1821.</h2>


<p><i>May, 1821.</i> <cite>A Smoky House and a Scolding Wife.</cite> Published at 22 Marylebone
Street, Portland Chapel.&mdash;A suffering mortal is seated at an unfurnished
dinner-table; the man's hands are clasped, his brows are knit, and his lips tightly
closed, in an effort to maintain his patience and his temper under two exasperating
provocatives to violence. Placed before the bent-down martyr to domestic
infirmities is a phantom bone of mutton; presumably the husband has taken
exception both to the insufficiency of the joint and the superabundance of smoke,
which is eddying round in volumes, and is filling the apartment with dense blackness;
while his better half, sailing like a fury out of the gloom, is an object to
inspire terror in the boldest heart, and the stings of the sharp tongue are apparently
even more intimidating than her nails or her knuckles, all of which
weapons of offence are enlisted against her pitiable helpmate.</p>

<p>1821. <cite>Tricks on the Turf, or Settling how to Lose a Race.</cite> Published by T.
Rowlandson.&mdash;A scene on a racecourse; the race-horses, led round to be saddled,
are seen in the background. A smart young jockey, with his saddle strapped
across his own back, and whip in hand, in readiness to begin the race, is receiving
the parting instructions of a wily old turfite, who wears a cocked hat, a pigtail,
a triple-caped coat, top-boots and spurs. This shrewd trickster is evidently
giving his rider certain secret instructions which he would probably not like to
hear published abroad on his own authority. The subject of this satire, together
with the scandals about the Prince of Wales's horse <em>Escape</em> and his jockey, prove
that even in the early days of the Turf its reputation was not immaculate nor its
patrons above suspicion.</p>

the territory of Baden to that of France without carrying along with him a
certain respect for his country, which he will act wisely to conceal, like any other
contraband commodity. This precaution I impressed upon myself as soon as
the four horses, whose neighing seemed to express the same feeling, were put to
the carriage at the last post-station at Kehl.</p>

<p>'This little place, situated partly on one, and partly on the other side of the
Rhine, possesses an equivocal sort of character, which, like the modest, innocent
look of a frail fair one, is of great advantage in the way of its trade.</p>

<p>'The reflections on that extraordinary genius Voltaire, whom the mercantile
spirit of Beaumarchais contrived to banish to this intermediate spot between
Germany and France&mdash;excited as I passed the extensive printing office established
here for promoting the circulation of his works&mdash;were too multifarious for the
shortest of all stages; for the life of this extraordinary mortal would afford abundant
matter for contemplation during a tour round the globe, without being even
then exhausted. My mind standing before him, like a dwarf before a colossus,
was about to measure his greatness, when I was under the disagreeable necessity
of turning the looks of my admiration another way, in order to cast them with
contempt upon the most miserable of all the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">employ&eacute;s</i> of the King, who waited
my arrival at the barriers of Strasburg. The postilion seemed to be thinking
no more about them than myself, but the cry of "Stop, scoundrel!" from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_370" id="Page_ii_370">[370]</a></span>
throats of ten of these varlets suddenly arrested the smart trot at which he was
about to pass them. I was instantly surrounded by the rascals, who enquired
what I would give to save my baggage from examination. "Nothing! nothing!"
cried I, in a tone that would have scared the nymphs of the Rhine. "Nothing?"
re-bellowed the incorruptible agents of the Custom House. "Nothing!" I reiterated.
"I never make bargains with such fellows." With a profusion of curses
and oaths they fell to work upon my baggage, which they ransacked with all the
avidity of rats that have got scent of a savoury piece of bacon.</p>

child by its right name?&mdash;had received a severe reproof.'</p>

<p>Introduction to the history of <em>Qu&aelig; Genus</em>.&mdash;'The favour which has been
bestowed on the different tours of Doctor Syntax has encouraged the writer of
them to give a "History of the Foundling," who has been thought an interesting
object in the latter of those volumes, and it is written in the same style and manner,
with a view to connect it with them.</p>

<p>'This child of chance, it is presumed, is led through a track of life not unsuited
to the peculiarity of his condition and character, while its varieties, as in the
former works, are represented by the pencil of Mr. Rowlandson with its accustomed
characteristic felicity.</p>

<p>'The idea of an English <em>Gil Blas</em> predominated through the whole of this
volume, which must be considered as fortunate in no common degree, if its
readers, in the course of their perusal, should be disposed to acknowledge even
a remote similitude to the incomparable works of Le Sage.</p>

<p><i>June 13, 1823.</i> <cite>Not at Home, or a Disappointed Dinner-hunter.</cite> Published
by John Fairburn. Broadway, Ludgate Hill.&mdash;The dinner-hunter, evidently a
well-to-do but miserly person, to whom avarice dictates the pursuit of the victuals
of his acquaintances, has called at the well-appointed house of a friend at the
exact dinner-hour, since a boy from an adjacent public-house is handing in the
beer; but the footman, who recognises the visitor's object, is prepared with the
chilling information, 'Not at home.' On the opposite side of the street is represented
an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&agrave; la mode</i> beef shop, to which sundry stout diners are resorting. The
execution of this plate is above the average, the etching being worked out with
both care and spirit. A companion print, executed with similar finish, was issued
by the same publisher.</p>

<p><i>June 19, 1823.</i> <cite>An Old Poacher Caught in a Snare.</cite>&mdash;The old poacher has
evidently come on a dangerous quest, and is fairly trapped. The object of his
snares, a handsome and elegantly-drawn lady, is thrusting the old sinner, suddenly
disturbed by the unexpected return of the husband, into the embrasure of
the fireplace, and endeavouring to conceal the marauder with the board which
was used to close the chimneypiece. The injured spouse has evidently been
out hunting, and has purposely returned on a more particular quest; whip in
hand, he is bursting into the room. The hat and stick of the hoary poacher are
thrown to the ground, and the hunter's hounds are tearing in on a good scent
which promises fitting retribution to be dealt on the head of the detected evil-doer.</p>

<p><i>September 18, 1823.</i> <cite>The Chance-seller of the Exchequer Putting an Extinguisher
on Lotteries.</cite> Published by Tom Brown, Peter Street, Westminster.&mdash;The
Chancellor of the Exchequer is literally extinguishing Fortune, who is represented
as a comely and youthful winged female holding a well-filled purse in
one hand and a lottery prize for 2,000<i>l.</i> in the other. At her feet are caskets of
gems and jewels; she is seated on well-filled sacks; behind her is the wheel
of fortune. A crowd of Bluecoat Boys are urging their entreaties. 'Come,
madam,' cries the Chancellor, 'put on your nightcap.' A chorus of cries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_375" id="Page_ii_375">[375]</a></span>
disappointment proceeds from a mob of persons in front. One agonised lady of
elegant exterior is praying: 'Stop; let me get a prize first.' A laundress, pointing
to the washing-tub, cries, 'Let her alone; take off the soap tax.' 'Shut up
the subscription houses,' urges another. A cobbler shouts, 'Give us a lottery,
and no leather tax;' another cries out, 'No tax on tallow,' and a parson denounces
horse-racing. On the column behind Madame Fortune suggestive
placards are pasted: 'Races, King's Cup,' 'Reform Parliament, Public Morals,'
and '<em>Fudge: a Farce</em>.' Various Ministerial and Parliamentary critics are discussing
the new measure. One is saying, 'Little Van [Vansittart] knew better
than to abolish a voluntary tax;' another is pointing out, 'He's only a young
Chancellor;' while a third, alluding to the popular outcry in relation to existing
imposts, remarks, 'Hear, hear! I knew they'd grumble.' A less disinterested
party is taking the opportunity to secure prize bags, gold-dust 'pickings and
fillings' from the upset of Fortune's cornucopia; he cries, 'Persevere, and the
saints shall praise you.'</p>

<p>1823. <a href="#TOOTHACHE"><cite>The Toothache, or Torment and Torture.</cite></a>&mdash;The village Jack-of-all-trades,
a very imposing, grave, and learned professor in appearance, is drawn in
the exercise of one branch of his multifarious vocations. A stout wench has
called in to have an obstinate grinder dragged out of her head; '<em>torment and
torture</em>' are mild terms for the operation. The patient is seated in the chair of
agony. Factotum's assistant, a lad whose offices seem as diversified as those of
his master, has brought an elegant pair of horse-pliers for the delicate process of
extraction. A dog is setting up a sympathetic howl; this animal is one of the grotesque
nondescripts which Rowlandson delighted to depict after his own theories,
careless whether literal critics, unfamiliar with his admirable studies after nature,
took upon themselves to assert that he could not master the drawing of animals.
From the agonised expression which the artist has succeeded in throwing into
the canine features it would appear as if Toby was also a patient attending the
dentist's tender offices in his turn. An old country dame who is also distracted
with a raging molar is waiting without. One branch of our friend's business is
obviously flourishing. Although the rustic practitioner does not display his
diploma from the College of Surgeons, or his licence to kill by authority, he has
nailed up a certificate with which, it is probable, he is equally satisfied: '<em>Barnaby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_376" id="Page_ii_376">[376]</a></span>

is an air of verisimilitude about this advertisement which reads like an actual
transcript.</p>

<p>1825. <cite>Bernard Blackmantle</cite> (Charles Molloy Westmacott). <em>The English
Spy.</em> The illustrations designed by Robert Cruikshank. In two volumes.
London, 8vo. Plate 32. <a href="#R_A_YS"><cite>R.&mdash;A.&mdash;ys of Genius Reflecting on the True Line of
Beauty at the Life Academy, Somerset House.</cite></a> By Thomas Rowlandson.&mdash;This
plate, which is dated June 1, 1824 (published by Sherwood &amp; Jones), was not, we
fancy, designed expressly for the <em>English Spy</em>, as we cannot fail to recognise it
as an adaptation of a very spirited caricature by the artist belonging to a considerably
earlier period, and described as <em>Drawing from the Nude</em>. In the
original the students are dressed in the costume of some forty years anterior to
1824; their quainter persons are delineated with more grotesque spirit and
boldness of treatment. Be this as it may, whether Rowlandson has obliged
his friend Westmacott by adding new figures, or whether the original design has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_379" id="Page_ii_379">[379]</a></span>
been otherwise supplemented with later portraits, the female model remains much
as she is found in the larger drawing. The artists, who are working from the life
in this more modern version, are chiefly Royal Academicians, as far as the privileged
circle is concerned, and the portraits are studied with care. M. A. Shee
is seated on the ground; one of the Landseers is above him; the person of Benjamin
West, arrayed in decorous black, with his knee-breeches, silk stockings,
and laced frill, bears a resemblance to a Court physician; Westmacott, Jones, Chantrey,
and half a dozen other artists, evident likenesses, are portrayed with a certain
attention to securing resemblance. In the right-hand corner, standing at an easel,
is the figure of B. R. Haydon; and seated between this unfortunate artist and the
fair model is another student, on whose drawing-board are the initials 'C. W.,'
which may be intended as a complimentary introduction of the person of Charles
Westmacott, the author of the publication in question. This plate, which is
a highly interesting addition to Blackmantle's <em>English Spy</em>, is the only full-page
illustration due to the caricaturist; and Mr. William Bates, B.A., commenting
on this contribution in an interesting sketch of Rowlandson's works, pronounces
it decisively 'the best plate in the work.' The first volume contains numerous
vignettes on wood, which the index describes as being 'from original designs
by Cruikshank, Rowlandson, Gillray, and Finlay, engraved by Bonner and
Hughes.' These engravings are neither signed nor ascribed to the respective
designers mentioned in the index; but, as far as we can trace, very little is offered
of Rowlandson's beyond the advertisement of his name.</p>

191 REGENT STREET, 1831.</p>

<p>The author, in his preface, thus refers to the circumstances under which these
illustrations by a deceased artist have been imported into an annual:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Of the embellishments to which, after the manner of annuals in general, the
matter has been adapted, it will be a sufficient recommendation to state that the
designs have been carefully selected from a great variety of original drawings by
the late Mr. Rowlandson, the humour of whose pencil has been long universally
acknowledged, and no expense has been spared to render the engravings worthy
of the subjects.'</p>

<p>The principal illustrations are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>
Frontispiece. <cite>The Humourist and her Crew.</cite>&mdash;The model of a ship, drawn<br />
by a donkey, followed by an escort of seamen, who have severally lost a leg in the<br />
service of their country; they are singing lustily, and appealing to the charitably<br />
inclined.</p>

<p>Vignette. Umbrella flirtations on horseback.</p>

<p><cite>The March of Intellect.</cite>&mdash;A bibliophilist doctor rummaging a bookstall.</p>

<p><cite>The Man of Business.</cite>&mdash;A grave curmudgeon turning his back on the beguilements
of certain pretty oyster-wenches at their stall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_381" id="Page_ii_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p><cite>The Rivals.</cite>&mdash;A scene outside the premises of Dorothy Dump, clear-starcher,
and the box of a tailor. The knight of the thimble has thrust his head out of
his narrow window, while he listens in consternation to the railings of the elderly
clear-starcher, who is jealously disputing the right of a young and buxomly-developed
fair to the attentions of the 'snip' their neighbour.</p>

<p><cite>An Enemy bearing down: Hope in the distance.</cite>&mdash;An enraged bull is throwing
various rural pedestrians into commotion. A stout lady is endeavouring to
escape over a stile; a one-legged veteran is hurrying her movements, as his own
position is becoming precarious; and a young damsel is left sprawling on the
grass; meanwhile the infuriated brute is receiving a check from a dog, which he
is endeavouring to toss.</p>

<p><cite>Too Hot and too Late.</cite>&mdash;Several stout Sunday excursionists, at various distances
apart, are toiling up a hill in the broiling midday sun to reach a suburban tavern,
where is held, as was the custom at that period, an ordinary on holidays for the
benefit of Cockney travellers. A stout pedestrian, mopping his forehead, and
followed by his panting dog, who takes after his master in obesity, is at the
bottom of the hill; the pair are evidently epicures, and the prospect of the ascent
with the probability of arriving only to find the viands swept away by the eager
appetites of earlier arrivals is evidently filling their minds with dread.</p>

<p><cite>Fire and Water.</cite>&mdash;A riverside alehouse; customers on benches, indulging in
pots and pipes. A waterman, who is probably indebted to the alewife, is receiving
a warm reception on the ground of unliquidated scores of long standing
which he has attempted to increase.</p>

<p><cite>Steering.</cite>&mdash;An old admiral, driving his wife in a curricle, has some difficulty
in restraining the skittishness of a pair of badly-trained steeds, whose eccentric
career is threatening the whole concern with annihilation.</p>

<p><cite>Bar Practice.</cite>&mdash;Interior of a tavern, guests at tables; in the front of the
picture is the saloon; a showy counter-maid is compounding a bowl of punch for
a brace of customers, a military and a sporting buck, who are leaning over the
bar and exchanging pleasantries with the landlady.</p>

<p><cite>Getting Cash for Notes.</cite>&mdash;A blind Scotch bagpiper, going his rounds of the
country, is passing a cottage; certain charitable damsels, who are clustered about
the portal are acknowledging the piper's notes with coppers.</p>

<p><cite>A Timekeeper.</cite>&mdash;A Doctor of Music, in his robes, is beating time with a roll
of music, and conducting a mixed choir of girls and lads; all the members
of the party are evidently bawling their utmost and straining their tuneful
throats.</p>

<p><cite>The Italian Scribe. An out-of-doors Amanuensis.</cite>&mdash;A similar subject to that
represented in the <cite>Letters from Italy</cite>, republished as <cite>Naples and the Campagna
Felice</cite> (1809&ndash;13). (See <a href="#LETTER"><cite>The Letter Writer</cite></a>, 1815.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_382" id="Page_ii_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p><cite>Love in a Box.</cite>&mdash;A Hebrew gentleman, evidently a Shylock, is gravely
trudging along the ways of some Continental city&mdash;it may be Venice&mdash;with a
bunch of keys in his hand; three picturesque and Masaniello-like looking porters
are in his train, one is bearing a trunk, and two are carrying, suspended on a pole,
a large square receptacle, the contents of which are implied to be of a romantic
nature.</p>

<p><cite>The Pleasures of Solitude.</cite>&mdash;An old gourmand is solacing his solitary state
of dining by an excess of creature-comforts; his servants are bringing in fresh
courses to add to a selection of dishes already amply sufficient for the needs of
an individual, and his butler is supplying him with wine on an excessive scale.</p>

<p><cite>Rich and Poor.</cite>&mdash;A pensioner, minus a leg, and otherwise under the 'slings
of adverse fortune,' has called to solicit some trifling assistance from a wealthy
sybarite; the poor man's exertions in the representation of his case seem thrown
away, as the person solicited is so deaf to his eloquence that, even with the
assistance of a trumpet, he fails to hear the appeal of the suitor.</p>

<p><cite>Village Politicians.</cite>&mdash;The wiseheads of the hamlet are portentously discussing
the contents of a news sheet in the vicinity of the sign of the 'Bugle
Horn.'</p>

<p><cite>A Disciplinarian.</cite>&mdash;A Zantippe of a wife, with a flood of invective, is driving
her cowed husband before her, whose advance is further accelerated by the liberal
exercise of a stout cudgel, which is raining strokes on the bent back of the unmanned
and overawed victim.</p>

<p><cite>An Admirer.</cite>&mdash;A comely maiden, standing with her pitcher beside a pump,
is asking assistance to raise her load of an idiotic rustic dandy, who is
staring and grinning his imbecile admiration with a face marvellously well
fitted to fill a horse-collar, but who does not otherwise respond to the girl's
request.</p>

<p><cite>The Cow Doctor.</cite>&mdash;A consultation over the condition of a suffering cow.</p>

<p><cite>Taking a Horse to Water.</cite>&mdash;In this case, it rather seems, the steeds are taking
their riders there and leaving them&mdash;soused in the brook.</p>

<p><cite>Lost and Won.</cite>&mdash;A gaily-apparelled nymph is leaning over the palings of a
waterside landing-stage. A waterman is looking on in dudgeon; he is evidently
the 'loser;' whilst the fickle fair is making tender demonstrations in favour of a
dashing young soldier, whose uniform and martial trim have evidently won the
changeable lady's heart.</p>

<p><cite>A Man of Colour.</cite>&mdash;At the portico of a villa stands the black butler, who is
emptying a plateful of victuals into the apron of a comely female tramp, with a
child slung on her back; the <em>darkie</em> is evidently moved by the attractions of the
gipsy, since his face expresses the most unqualified admiration for her personal
allurements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_383" id="Page_ii_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p><cite>Civic Enjoyments.</cite>&mdash;A dinner party assembled in a Guildhall. The health of
the entertainer is being uproariously received as a 'standing toast' with full-charged
bumpers.</p>

<p><cite>A Siege.</cite>&mdash;A highly genteel, youthful, and elegantly clad lady&mdash;whether maid
or widow it is difficult to determine&mdash;is surrounded by a crowd of suitors, recruited
from pretty nearly all the professions, and of all ages and sizes. The
object of this profuse idolatry, perfectly unmoved, is waving off her too presumptuous
assailants, whose assiduities interfere with her comfort.</p>

<p><a href="#RECRUITING"><cite>Recruiting.</cite></a>&mdash;A party of soldiers on ''listing' service in a country town have
secured certain volunteers. One of the new recruits, a sprightly damsel, is
creating no little consternation in the breasts of the villagers by joining the
troopers' march; a cobbler and a tailor, armed with the implements of their
trade, are offering some show of resistance to the abduction of this Helen by
a smart young Paris 'in the line;' but these deserted swains are kept at a respectful
distance by the bayonet of the gay Lothario's comrade.</p>

<p><cite>Knowledge of the World.</cite>&mdash;A village pedagogue is instructing his pupils in
that elaborate branch of fashionable education (according to school prospectuses
at the beginning of the century), 'the use of the globes.' Certain mischievous
urchins are taking advantage of the preceptor's preoccupation to insert quill pens
into the 'Busby' wig of the learned Doctor.</p>

<p><cite>Modern Antiquities.</cite>&mdash;A variation of the larger engraving on this subject
published (by Tegg) under the same title.</p>

<p><cite>A Man of Taste.</cite>&mdash;A fat old voluptuary, in a 'nautical rig,' in person not
unlike (and probably expressly designed for) the convivial and yachting alderman,
Sir William Curtis, is critically inspecting through his eyeglass a small selection
of shellfish held out for his gratification by a pretty shrimper-maid of pronounced
personal graces.</p>

<p><cite>Looking a Broadside.</cite>&mdash;A stout party of the old school, of great breadth and
solidity, is looking daggers at a dandified fop of the period, a mere scarecrow of
a figure, who is 'quizzing' the substantial piece of antiquity through a spyglass.
The indignation of the old boy is barely appeased by the soothing caresses of a
tender and pretty maiden who is clinging to the incensed veteran.</p>

<p><cite>Credulity.</cite>&mdash;A fashionable, elegant, and good-looking lady is seated at her
breakfast-table, while her maid is arranging the apartment. A messenger or
letter-carrier has just brought a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billet-doux</i>, which the confiding beauty is eagerly
perusing.</p>

<p><cite>Indecision.</cite>&mdash;An obese prebendary, his gouty limb supported on cushions, is
in all the perplexities of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embarras de choix</i>; one maiden is bringing in poultry, as
appropriate to the day's dinner, shortly to follow in due course; and a fish-girl
has offered an equally attractive choice of fish. The arrival of these luxuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_384" id="Page_ii_384">[384]</a></span>
and the necessity of selecting between them is vexing the soul of the good
man.</p>

<p><cite>Spoiling a Cloak and Making a Fortune.</cite>&mdash;Another version of the traditional
episode of the gallant Raleigh laying down his mantle at the feet of his sovereign
lady Queen Elizabeth to bridge over an undesirable crossing.</p>

<p><cite>A Military Salute.</cite>&mdash;A gallant officer engaged in amorous dalliance with
a tender-hearted fair, who is leaning out of a cottage window to receive the
courtesies of the dashing warrior. Another version of <cite><a href="#KISSING">Kissing for Love</a>, or
Captain Careless Shot Flying by a Girl of Fifteen, who unexpectedly popped her
Head out of a Casement</cite> (May 1810).</p>

<p><cite>A Bagman.</cite>&mdash;A tired commercial traveller, cloaked, booted, and spurred, is
alighting at the 'Woolpack;' his horse is taken to the stable; his saddle-bag is
under his arm; and the buxom and broadly-expanded hostess of the inn is standing
at the portal to bid the weary pilgrim welcome.</p>

<p><cite>Obtaining the Countenance of the Minister.</cite>&mdash;An Italian itinerant vendor of
'images' is offering a citizen the chance of purchasing the head of the Government
on easy terms, as far as his plaster bust is concerned.</p>

<p><cite>Training.</cite>&mdash;A jockey, with his saddle strapped on his back, ready to mount
for the race, is receiving the final and special instructions of his patron, a
venerable and evidently deep file, well versed in the iniquities of the turf, whose
face wears an expression of experienced and long-trained cunning. Another
version of <cite>Tricks of the Turf, or Settling how to Lose a Race</cite> (1821).</p>

<p><cite>An Exhibition.</cite>&mdash;The fashionable attendants at a gallery of pictures. All the
spectators are lost in wonder and admiration at the collection of paintings. The
figure of the Duke of Gloucester is 'taken off,' with that of other visitors. A
partial transcript of the <cite>Portrait Painters Gallery.&mdash;Adventures of Johnnie
Qu&aelig; Genus</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>A Banquet.</cite>&mdash;Three <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">convives</i> are enjoying their soup, seated in a sort of
supper-box; the French <em>chef</em> is prominently shown before his cooking-range,
busied in the compounding of some extensive <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pot au feu</i>.</p>

<p><cite>The Ratcatcher.</cite>&mdash;As the title expresses, the figure of a professional ratcatcher,
with a cage full of prisoners, which he is exhibiting to a venerable couple&mdash;probably
his employers; his dogs are excited at the prospect of the sport. Another
version of Rowlandson's <cite>London Characters</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>A Court Day.</cite>&mdash;A small rendering of <cite>A Lev&eacute;e at St. James's Palace</cite>. The
Beef-eaters are on duty, and crowds of courtiers and distinguished representatives,
clerical, military, diplomatic, civil, foreign, &amp;c., are proceeding through the reception-room
for the privilege of making their bow to royalty.</p>

<p><cite>A Dark Prospect.</cite>&mdash;A master-sweeper and his lad are seated, on their soot-bags,
by the can of a pretty and picturesquely-attired dairymaid, who has supplied
the dark customers with cups of 'clean milk from the cow.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_385" id="Page_ii_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p><cite>Symptoms of a Dinner.</cite>&mdash;A meeting of dignified prelates of the Church;
amongst the company are certain bigwigs, bishops, who are received with flattering
deference by the lower clergy. Two eager members of the cloth, more
set on the serious gratifications of a Convocation festival than the empty ceremonial
courtesies of the hour, are examining a sun-dial in the foreground and
comparing it with their watches, in expectation of dinner-time.</p>

<p><cite>The Studio.</cite>&mdash;A painter, in Court costume, is daubing away boldly at his
picture, surrounded at a respectful distance by a circle of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">dilettanti</i> connoisseurs,
all of whom sport spectacles or eyeglasses; these critical spectators are engaged
in cold contemplation of the work before them.</p>

<p><i>Vignette.</i>&mdash;A second group of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cognoscenti</i>, whose faces in this case express
more interest and admiration, and justly so, since the work before them appeals to
their tenderest susceptibilities; it is one they can all appreciate&mdash;a lively turtle,
ready to be converted into real soup. A number of clergymen are following the
lead of their bishop, who, excellent man, is evidently longing to bless the good
things which beneficent Nature has here provided for the faithful.</p>

<p><cite>Hydrophobia: the Church in Danger.</cite>&mdash;A pastor is running his hardest,
pursued by a dog, which we are to suppose is suffering from <em>rabies</em>; the venerable
prelate is doing his best to keep in advance of his pursuer, who in turn is followed
by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"> poss&eacute;</i> of eager philanthropists, armed with pitchforks, flails, spits, pokers,
choppers, shovels, and even pistols and guns, which are being discharged ineffectually,
as the dog is managing to keep ahead of his would-be executioners.</p>

<p><cite>The Way to Fill a Wherry.</cite>&mdash;A party, including the fair, have secured their
places in a wherry at the riverside; the waterman is taking in one more customer
before starting, an elephantine and venerable gentleman, whose advent
has filled the occupants of the bark with alarm, the aquatic party evidently anticipating
that they will be swamped at the very least by the ponderous weight of
the last comer, who is vainly trying to find a seat in the boat without capsizing it.</p>

<p><cite>A View of the Coast.</cite>&mdash;A village inn, with a blind fiddler and his daughter
stationed upon the green outside; almost identical with the subject published by
Ackermann in Rowlandson's <cite>World in Miniature</cite> (see <a href="#ALE_HSE">April 1, 1816</a>).</p>

<p><cite>Operatives.</cite>&mdash;The title of this plate goes by contraries. <cite>Inoperatives</cite> should
be the description. A pair of soakers are sunk in heavy slumber over the
table of the taproom; a brace of industrious working-men, whose ambitions in
the direction of exertion are limited to 'raising their elbows,' 'tilting measures,'
'reducing the liquid contents of receptacles for intoxicants,' and similar performances
of an anti-temperance order.</p>

<p><cite>Home, Sweet Home.</cite>&mdash;A drunken convivialist is, pipe in hand, unconsciously
approaching the spot whose praises he is tipsily chaunting, quite unprepared for
the reception that is awaiting his roystering at the hands of his outraged and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_386" id="Page_ii_386">[386]</a></span>
furiously indignant wife, who is anticipating his arrival with a cane prudently
provided in advance for further arguments upon the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douceurs</i> of his rooftree.</p>

<p>The last print in Volume I. of <cite>The Humourist</cite> is a vignette representing a
bench of fox-hunting justices, who have gone fast asleep in their respective armchairs,
their legs on the table; bottles and bowls strewing the floor, and their
dogs, scattered around, sunk in sleep as heavy as that indulged in by their
masters. A transcript of the plate <cite>Johnny Qu&aelig; Genus Attending on a Sporting
Finale&mdash;Adventures of Johnny Qu&aelig; Genus</cite> (1832).</p>

<p>The illustrations to Volume II. of <cite>The Humourist</cite> are supplied by another
hand. It does not contain any further rendering of subjects after Rowlandson.</p>

<p class="ph3"><a name="ADDENDUM_TO_THE_CHRONOLOGICAL_SUMMARY_OF" id="ADDENDUM_TO_THE_CHRONOLOGICAL_SUMMARY_OF"></a><i>ADDENDUM TO THE CHRONOLOGICAL SUMMARY OF
ROWLANDSON'S CARICATURES.</i></p>

<p>The Editor has found it necessary to append a supplementary list of subjects which have been
brought under his notice too late either to be arranged in the body of the present work, or even
to be comprised in the general chronological summary; his attention being directed to these
additional caricatures long after he had reluctantly arrived at the conclusion that it was hopeless to
expect to render the foregoing classification more complete.</p>

<p>In the Introduction to this review of pictorial satires by Thomas Rowlandson allusions will be
found (vol. i. p. 4) to a noteworthy collection of his productions, both social and political, in course
of formation by Mr. F. Harvey, of St. James's Street, the result of many years' vigilant activity in
securing everything of consequence by the artist which happened to come into the print market,
with comparative indifference to cost.</p>

<p>The arrangement of this gathering, already amounting to twenty-three volumes, consisting
entirely of excellent examples of the caricaturist's engraved works, has been proceeding coincidently
with the preparation of the present volumes, and both selections have been brought as
near to completion as is practicable at precisely the same time.</p>

<p>The writer has the satisfaction of realising that the promise referred to in his preface, made by
Mr. Harvey many years ago, has been redeemed before it is altogether worthless, as concerns his
desire to supply a summary of the caricaturist's published productions as comprehensive as circumstances
are likely to permit, to which much importance is attached from a collector's point of view.</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged that the extensive accumulation in the possession of Mr. Harvey has
contributed to this result, if at the eleventh hour; in his collection numerous examples of interest
are found which have hitherto escaped the Editor's researches. Many of the titles set down in the
body of the foregoing Summary and in the Addendum, drawn from the resources placed at his
disposal by the kindness of Mr. Harvey, are in all probability perfectly novel to the majority of
even experienced 'Rowlandson fanciers.'</p>

<p class="center">ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF REFERENCE UPON ROWLANDSON'S CARICATURES.</p>
<p class="center small">CATALOGUE OF PRINTS AND DRAWINGS IN THE BRITISH
MUSEUM.</p>


<p>Further information is open to enquirers who are interested in tracing the
works of the caricaturist. The important catalogue of the satirical prints and
drawings in the British Museum, now in course of publication, will include all the
examples found in that institution, if the Trustees decide to continue it beyond the
limit originally settled (about 1770). The preparation of the catalogue in question,
which has been placed in the hands of probably the very ablest authority on the
subject of satire who has ever lived, is of necessity a work of time. The elucidation
of the earlier graphic satires has occupied years of patient industry, by
which alone the social and political pictorial 'skits' could be made intelligible&mdash;an
undertaking which the lapse of time annually makes more complicated as regards
the interpretation of those lighter trifles of bygone times, which, in spite of their
triviality, often possess an historical value, unintelligible to the majority of
students, because hidden away in the obscurity of allusions beyond the vision of
the present generation.</p>

<p>The task of tracing and explaining the intentions of the graphic satirists,
commenced by Mr. Edward Hawkins, original owner of an immense collection
of their works, is being continued and successfully carried out for the Trustees of
the British Museum by Mr. Frederic George Stephens. The catalogue, an important
contribution to the history of the subject, has, as we have said, already
been years in hand, and is slowly but surely advancing through the comparatively
lost paths of the past. A new light has been thrown upon the satires of the
times of the Tudors, the Stuarts, the Commonwealth, the Restoration, the accession
of the Prince of Orange and of the House of Hanover. The results of the
editor's painstaking researches are completed and open for consultation up to the
conclusion of the Hogarth period; the notices upon the works of the great
luminary of the school, which are included in the volume published in the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_412" id="Page_ii_412">[412]</a></span>
year, will be found of so thoroughly exhaustive a character, that the interest
generally felt in Hogarth is likely to be increased, especially as a considerable
amount of entirely new and curious matter has been discovered by Mr. Stephens
in the course of his investigations.</p>


<p class="ph3">CATALOGUE OF PRINTS AND DRAWINGS IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM.</p>

<p>Div. 1. Political and Personal Satires. Prepared for publication by Frederic George
Stephens, and containing many descriptions by Edward Hawkins, late Keeper of the
Antiquities, F.S.A. Printed by order of the Trustees. With an introduction by George
William Reid, Esq., Keeper of the Prints and Drawings in the British Museum.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A selection of subjects, treated by Rowlandson with more freedom than is consonant
with the taste of the latter half of the nineteenth century, is also given by PISANUS
FRAXI, in his elaborate and exhaustive work CENTURIA LIBRORUM ABSCONDITORUM
(1879). Pisanus Fraxi has set down (pp. 346&ndash;398) descriptions of over one
hundred and twenty subjects of more or less erotic tendency. The major part of the
etchings included by this authority are of necessity inadmissible in the present work, owing
to their licentious suggestiveness; but a few of the subjects described in the 'Centuria
Librorum Absconditorum,' restricted exclusively to social caricatures by Rowlandson, the
originals of which maybe consulted in the Print Room and Library of the British Museum,
are also instanced in the foregoing pages.</p>

the following introduction fully explains:
'This second tour is, like the former one, a
work of suggestions from the plates by Mr.
Rowlandson, though not with such entire
reserve as the first. Some few of the subjects
may have been influenced by hints
from me; and I am willing to suppose that
such are the least amusing of them.'&mdash;<cite>Introduction

<li>Mr. Combe no doubt thought it as well, although
availing himself of the hint that hunting was

the fact of the Doctor being asked to join

<p class="ph3">ORIGINAL DRAWINGS BY THOMAS ROWLANDSON IN POSSESSION
OF W. R. BAKER, J.P., ESQ., OF BAYFORDBURY PARK, HERTFORD.</p>

<p>At Bayfordbury Park&mdash;where, it will be remembered, the celebrated collection of the Kit Cat
Club, a national gallery of portraits, by Sir Godfrey Kneller, of the most interesting
character, has its home&mdash;the choice examples of Rowlandson's skill appear to have been
secured by the family at one time, and that at what may be considered the artist's best
period&mdash;a little before the production of <cite>Vauxhall Gardens</cite>, and the series contributed
to the exhibitions of the Royal Academy.</p>

<ul class="list"><li>The Bath Coffee House. A highly amusing interior,
representing the various fashionable
characters to be met with on the Great
Bath and Bristol Road a century back.</li>

<li>Rustic Scene. Carters' horses watering.</li>

<li>Scene outside a Lodge in a London Park,
crowded with animated groups of folks of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon ton</i>, as they might be seen disporting
themselves in the fashionable resorts, where
the 'best company' of the day was to be
encountered in 1785.</li>

<li>The Waggoner's Halt.</li>

<li>Sailors Soliciting Charity. A party of Rodney's
'old salts,' disabled, and reduced to appeal
to charity; a model of a ship-of-war is
dragged about on wheels to attract the attention
and sympathies of the passers-by.</li>

<li>French Barracks, 1786. A highly finished
example of one of Rowlandson's most
famous subjects (exhibited at the Royal
Academy, 1787). It probably preceded
the exhibited drawing, since it is executed
on a somewhat reduced scale to that of the
engraving. A full description of this admirable
design is given under the list of
subjects belonging to 1791 (Aug. 12).</li>

<li>Death and the Apothecary. This subject is
drawn in Rowlandson's most careful method.
In the writer's opinion it is one of
the earliest examples of the artist's finished
works which have come under his attention,
and is probably of the same date as the
<cite>School of Eloquence</cite>, mentioned under 1780,
which, as he has noted, has suffered at the
hands of the anonymous etcher. Death,
as a grim skeleton, is intruding into the
apartment of an invalid by the window;
the patient has armed himself with a gruelspoon
to ward off this sudden attack from
the unassailable foe, while a corpulent
apothecary, standing in ambush behind his
client, has snatched up a gigantic syringe,
which he is pointing, by way of a great gun,
at the bony framework of the ghastly actor
who has dropped in to complete the quack's
handiwork and snatch away a profitable
customer. The whole of the background
is worked out like a fine etching, in a
fainter line than the figures, much in the
style which distinguishes the etchings of
Mortimer.</li>

<li>Hertford Market Place (market day). This
view of the old county town of Hertford
is one of the finest and most interesting of
those drawings which Rowlandson has left
of the quaint towns of his day. It is altogether
of an important character, being
nearly 30 inches in length. It represents
the Town Hall, the market-place, and
certain picturesque ancient houses, faced
with carved scroll-work, which front the
corner hard by. The traveller will find
these buildings exactly as Rowlandson
viewed them a century ago; and, on a
market-day, he will see the dealers' stalls,
the country people busying themselves
about their purchases, and the gentry
passing or riding by, called to the town on
local affairs, in some respects the same as a
century ago. This scene, animated in itself
as it is presented in our day, falls very far
short of the prospect the artist has preserved,
for the antique costumes have disappeared;
and, comfortable as may be those of the
generation who occupy themselves on the
spot, the attractions found in the caricaturist's
picture are looked for in vain;
for the light flowing robes, the hats and
feathers which aided the winning graces

THOMAS CAPRON, ESQ., ARUNDEL HOUSE, RICHMOND.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Capron's selection contains numerous subjects from the collections of Lord Farnham
and the late W. T. Ashley, Esq. Besides being the owner of a very fine selection of
the best prints after Rowlandson, many of considerable size, value, and importance,
(for the loan of several choice examples, which are both rare and difficult to obtain,
the writer begs to record his grateful acknowledgments to the fortunate possessor;)

<p>The drawings mentioned above, like most of the caricaturist's fluent renderings of subjects
after the Old Masters, are far removed from mere copies or servile imitations, being,
in actual fact, free adaptations of the works in question, strongly characterised with
the individualities of Rowlandson's style.</p>

<p>Colonel Weston, in addition to this unique series, possesses a collection of original drawings
by the artist, which includes, among numerous interesting examples of varying
importance, one of Rowlandson's most graceful and finished drawings, worked out
with a taste and delicacy altogether remarkable. The subject is a domestic scene,
introducing two charming figures (likenesses in all probability) executed after the style
of the portrait of Morland (mentioned in the first part of this work, now in the Print
Room, British Museum, see <a href="#Page_ii_412">p. 412</a>), and evidently executed at the same period.</p></blockquote>

<p class="ph3">LIST OF ORIGINAL DRAWINGS BY THOMAS ROWLANDSON IN THE
COLLECTION OF WILLIAM BATES, ESQ., B.A., M.R.C.S, &amp;c.,
BIRMINGHAM.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<ul class="list"><li>'Cornish Peasantry.' 10&frac14;&times;6&frac12;. Five peasants,
admirably grouped, seated on a sort of
timber-cart, drawn by two oxen. Woody
background. Signed 'Rowlandson.'</li>

<li>Acis and Galatea. 8&frac12;&times;6.</li>

<li>Apollo and Daphne. 8&frac12;&times;6. Companion to
the above. A vigorously-drawn recollection
of the antique.</li>

<li>The Cottage Door. 11&frac12;&times;8&frac12;. A group of
rustics seated at the door of a cottage. On
the right hand a man with a donkey laden
with vegetables. In the manner of Morland.</li>

<li>'The Road to Ruin.' 13&frac12;&times;9&frac12;. The young
squire is seated at a round table, with his
mistress on his knee. Opposite to him is a
'led-captain,' dealing out cards and inciting
the squire to bet. In the centre, standing
at the table, is a plethoric chaplain, wholly
intent upon the manufacture of a bowl of
punch, the ingredients for which he is
pouring simultaneously from two bottles
into the bowl. The complete absorption
of each of these personages in his own
special object is admirably depicted.</li>

<li>Brentford Market Place. 17&frac12;&times;12. An admirable
drawing, exhibiting hundreds of
market-people disposed in groups, with the
Town House in the central background and
the 'Three Kings' inn on the right hand.
The grouping is excellent, the scene full of
animation and bustle, the sense of space
and general keeping perfect, and the whole
equal in power and effect to the works of
the Dutch painters.</li>

<li>Shepherd and Sheep. 17&frac14;&times;4&frac12;. A standing
figure in the middle of a group of five
sheep; something in the manner of Gainsborough.</li>

<li>The Funeral. 7&times;4&frac12;. The parson advances,
reading the burial service. Next comes
the clerk, carrying a child's coffin, and followed
by a group of female mourners,
wringing their hands, holding handkerchiefs
to their eyes, and some carrying umbrellas.
To the right a female gravedigger, holding
a spade in one hand and tolling the bell
with the other. To illustrate the old song
of 'The Vicar and Moses':&mdash;

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When come to the grave the clerk humm'd a stave,</span>
<span class="i2">Whilst the surplice was wrapped round the priest;</span>
<span class="i0">When so droll was the figure of Moses and Vicar,</span>
<span class="i2">That the parish still laugh at the jest.</span>
<span class="i24">Singing tol de rol, &amp;c.</span>
</div></div></div></li>

<li>An Oriental Scene. 8&frac12;&times;5&frac12;. In the foreground
a gibbet, from which is hanging in chains
the headless body of a woman. By the
side an impaling-stake and wheel. Two
men in foreign garb are looking on. In the
distance a city, with towers and minarets.</li>

<li>'The Industrious Wife and Idle Husband.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_430" id="Page_ii_430">[430]</a></span>
5&frac12;&times;4. The wife is busily engaged at the
washtub; a cradle, with twins asleep, at her
back; while the husband, with pipe, glass,
and jug, sits over the fire with a boon
companion. Full of Hogarthian humour.</li>

<li>Burglars Alarmed. 11&times;9&frac12;. A drawing of extraordinary
vigour. A brutal-looking ruffian,
in a frieze coat, holding a bloody knife in
one hand and enjoining attention with the
other, is striding over the corpses of two
women, both with their throats cut. A
second ruffian, with alarm depicted on his
countenance, holds a candle in his right
hand and grasps a bloodstained coal-hammer
in his left. In the background a
fate is seen peeping through a window. A
piece that can hardly be looked at without
a subsequent attack of nightmare.</li>

<li>Landscape. Lake scene, hilly background.
9&times;7. Very broad in treatment.</li>

<li>Commodore Trunnion and Lieut. Hatchway
on their way to the Wedding. 14&frac12;&times;8. (See
Smollett's 'Peregrine Pickle,' vol. i. chap. 8.)</li>

<li>Jolly Companions. 11&times;8. A group of five,
heads and shoulders. A man is apparently
singing from a ballad-sheet. A woman at
his right hand is blowing with the bellows,
and the other faces are on the broad grin.</li>

<li>The Pipe Dance. 4&frac12;&times;3. Two Punch-and-Judy-like
figures dancing, and holding a
pipe over head. Small, but very spirited.</li>

<li>The Forge. 9&frac12;&times;6&frac12;. A group of four horses
outside a forge. The blacksmith holds up
the hoof of one; the farmer stands by, and
a woman advances holding a cup of ale.
Signed 'Rowlandson, 1791.' As fine as
Morland.</li>

<li>Maternal Solicitude. 6&frac12;&times;4&frac34;. A mother bends
over her child on a couch, both entirely
nude.</li>

<li>Nymph and Cupid. 7&frac14;&times;5&frac12;. A naked nymph
recumbent; a winged cupid, bow in hand,
descends towards her.</li>

<li>Henpecked Husbands. 10&times;6&frac14;. A woman
has hold of the greatly elongated nose of
her husband in one hand, and belabours
him with a whip in the other. On the left
a group of women toss a husband in a
blanket, and on the right a wife is thrashing
her husband on the ground, whom she also
holds by the nose.</li>

<li>Death in the Pot. 6&times;3&frac12;. A plethoric figure
drinks from a bowl, while a skeleton figure
is about to strike him from above.</li>

<li>Zion Chapel. 13&frac12;&times;8&frac14;. A congregation of
over fifty persons, who have just emerged
from the portal of 'Zion Chaple' (<em>sic</em>), are
passing slowly along. The door is blocked
up by the departing worshippers; a fish-woman
standing by indulges in some ribald
observations, and a pious old lady holds up
her hands in horror.</li>

<li>The Table d'H&ocirc;te. 13&frac34;&times;9. A spirited and
characteristic drawing, exhibiting a numerous
company of both sexes seated at a
dinner-table. French waiters, pig-tailed
and nightcapped, are drawing corks, filling
glasses, and flying to and fro with dishes,
&amp;c. One of the guests is teaching a dog
to beg; a woman and girl, with tambourine
and triangle, appear on the left to amuse
the company.</li>

<li>Interior of a Prison. 9&frac12;&times;6. From the collection
of the celebrated Henry Angelo, the professor
of fencing, who in his 'Reminiscences'
(vol. ii. p. 324) gives an account of its
production. Rowlandson, it appears, had
been robbed one night, and went next day
in search of the thief. 'We first repaired,'
says the reminiscent, 'to St. Giles's, Dyott
Street, and Seven Dials. In one of the
night-houses four ill-looking fellows, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des
coupes-jarret</i>, so attracted our attention
that, whilst we sat over our noggins of
spirits, as he (Rowlandson) always carried
his sketch-book with him, he made an excellent
caricature group of them for me, introducing
a prison in the background....
He afterwards finished it for me in his best
style, superior to the greater part of his
works. This is now (1830) about forty
years ago. The coloured drawing was once
included in my collection.' Here we have
the four thieves sitting and lying in various
positions. Prisoners in another group are
playing cards. Another ruffian is stretched
at full length asleep in the foreground.
The drawing, grouping, and colouring are
alike admirable, and would have done
honour to Salvator Rosa.</li>

<li>'The Miser Lying in State: the Prodigal Heir-Apparent.'
14&times;9&frac12;. The 'heir-apparent,'
with his profligate companions, male and
female, is seated at a table, on which we
see a punchbowl, &amp;c. A coffin occupies
an elevated position in the background,
and from it appears to be struggling to
emerge the supposed defunct miser, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_431" id="Page_ii_431">[431]</a></span>
an allegorical figure above seems to be
nailing down the lid.</li>

<li>The Fire. 9&frac12;&times;6. On the right a house on
fire, flames issuing from the windows, the
doorway crowded with watermen, and persons
carrying out bedding and other effects.
On the left firemen manipulating the hose
and directing the stream against the flaming
windows, in ridiculously suggestive attitudes.
The central figure is an enormously fat
woman, whose night-dress, drawn up to
support a mass of crockery, displays her
<em>Rubensesque</em> and redundant charms to the
watermen, who turn their grinning faces to
gaze upon the spectacle.</li>

<li>'Leaving the Premises without Consulting the
Landlord.' 11&times;8&frac12;. A cart, seen at the
back, heaped up with furniture, occupies
the centre. A woman on the left laden
with gridirons, warming-pans, &amp;c. On the
right a girl, graceful as one of Stothard's
female figures, places in the cart a birdcage.
In the foreground miscellaneous
articles of minor furniture, and two children
playing with the house-cat.</li>

<li>Outside the Court-House. 14&frac12;&times;10&frac12;. The
scene is apparently the Magistrate's Court
and the Town Hall in some county town.
The ground in front is crowded with various
individuals waiting for the cases in which
they are interested to be called on. We
see the farmer, the parson, a jockey, a
huntsman, a footman, a butcher, a soldier,
an actor, and many others. The beadle is
seated on a step, making love to an old
woman, who holds a tankard in her hand.
Dogs are scattered about, attendant on
their masters.</li>

<li>Interior of Eating-House. 7&frac14;&times;5. A dining-table,
at which are seated some seventeen
people, male and female. One of the

put in a wheel, and a burning coal with him; he could not stop without burning his legs, and so was
kept on the full gallop. These dogs were by no means fond of their profession; it was indeed hard
work to them in a wheel for two or three hours, turning a piece of meat which was twice their own
weight. It is recorded of the turnspit-dogs of Bath that one Sunday, when they had, as usual, followed
their mistresses to church, the lesson of the day happened to be that chapter of Ezekiel wherein the
self-moving chariots are described. When the first word "wheel" was pronounced all the curs pricked
up their ears in alarm; at the second "wheel" they set up a doleful howl; and when the dreaded
word was uttered a third time every one of them scampered out of church as fast as he could, with
his tail between his legs.'&mdash;John Foster, in Hone's <cite>Everyday Book</cite>, December 17, 1826.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The advice offered in the concluding line of Daniel Lambert's advertisement must, however, be
followed with certain reserve. The Leicester giant's premature end is hardly an encouragement to
would-be imitators. After his first visit to London, in 1806, Daniel Lambert returned to his native
place; the year following he repeated his visit, but feeling oppressed by the atmosphere of the
metropolis, he made a tour through the principal provincial cities and towns, where he proved a great
source of attraction. We are told 'his diet was plain, and the quantity moderate, and for many years
he never drank anything stronger than water. His countenance was manly and intelligent; he possessed
great information, much ready politeness, and conversed with ease and facility. He had a
powerful and melodious tenor voice, and his articulation was perfectly clear and unembarrassed....
Lambert had, however, for some time shown dropsical symptoms. In June, 1809, he was weighed
at Huntingdon, and, by the Caledonian balance, was found to be 52 stone 11 lb.; 10 stone 4 lb. heavier
than Bright, the miller of Maiden, who only lived to the age of thirty.'
</p>
<p>
A few days after this last weight was taken, on June 20, Lambert arrived from Huntingdon at the
Wagon and Horses Inn, St. Martin's, Stamford, where preparations were made to receive company the
next day and during the Stamford races. He was announced for exhibition; he gave his orders cheerfully,
without any presentiment that they were to be his last. He was then in bed, only fatigued from his
journey, but anxious to see company early in the morning. Before nine o'clock, however, the day following,
he was a corpse! He died in his apartment on the ground-floor of the inn, for he had long been
incapable of walking up stairs. As may be supposed from his immense bulk and weight, his interment
was an arduous labour. His age was thirty-nine. At the Wagon and Horses Inn were preserved two
suits of Lambert's clothes; seven ordinary-sized men were repeatedly enclosed within his waistcoat,
without breaking a stitch or straining a button.</p></div>

Mr. Ephraim Hardcastle (Editor):&mdash;'Francisco Caracci was the younger brother of Augustino and
Annibale; and Antonio, called from his deformity Il Gobbo, was the natural son of Augustino.
These were the individuals who formed that celebrated family of painters. The father of Ludovico
Caracci was a butcher (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">era macelago</i>), and the father of Annibale and Augustino a tailor. Annibale
resolved to mortify the pride of Ludovico, who despised him on account of his frequently reminding
him of their low origin. He therefore privately painted the portraits of the Caracci, as large as life,
in a butcher's shop, and showed his picture for the first time to Ludovico, when in company with
Cardinal Farnese. It is now in the Guise collection, at Christ Church College, Oxford. Annibale is the
butcher weighing the meat, which a soldier (Ludovico) is purchasing. Augustino stands near them.
Antonio is lifting down a carcase, which conceals his deformity; and the old woman represents their
mother. General Guise is said to have given 1,100<i>l.</i> for this picture, which was purchased for him at
Venice. Talking of Oxford, did you ever see this collection? If the old General Guise had no more
taste for fighting than for painting, I would have met him and his legions with wooden cannon. Yet
I have heard certain <em>bigwigs</em> of the University crack up the Guise Gallery! They are nice social
fellows at Christ Church for all this, and men of taste; a conversation on painting is brought to table
in hall there, like the wine&mdash;devilishly well iced.'</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> A learned dancing-master in the University of Oxford, who taught politeness also, and published
a book upon that subject, fixed the same period for passing a stile in some cases that is here judiciously
recommended for the payment of an ostler. His precept was that a well-bred man meeting another
on the opposite side of a stile ought on no account to be persuaded to go over first. The name of
this ingenious author was Towle. Had two zealous pupils of his school met each other at a stile, it
is supposed they must have concluded their lives on the premises.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> George Stevens, the originator of the 'Lecture on Heads,' was a very indifferent actor, but a
man of humorous parts, and in himself was considered, by his contemporaries, most entertaining
company. The idea of the lecture was given him by a country carpenter, who made the character-blocks
which formed the subjects of illustration. It proved an extraordinary success in the hands of
the originator. He carried it about England, through the States of America, and, on his return, to
Ireland; and managed to net some ten thousand pounds by this lucky venture. After he retired
more than one actor attempted it, with poor results. Lewis was the most successful of Stevens's
imitators, and he had made such arrangements with the author as entitled the latter to a royalty for
the use of his 'Lecture on Heads.' It probably derived its principal charm from the style of its
delivery. Read in cold blood, its brilliancy and point are by no means startling.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Mary Moser, the lively lady Royal Academician, and famous flower-painter, writing to Mrs.
Lloyd, the first wife of the gentleman she subsequently honoured with her hand, conveys the following
account of the reigning mode in town, to her friend in the country: 'Come to London and admire
our plumes; we sweep the sky! a duchess wears six feathers, a lady four, and every milk-maid one
at each corner of her cap! Your mamma desired me to inquire the name of something she had seen
in the windows in Tavistock Street; it seems <em>she</em> was afraid to ask; but <em>I</em> took courage, and they told
me they were <em>rattle-snake tippets</em>; however, notwithstanding their frightful name, they are not unlike a
<em>beaufong</em>, only the quills are made stiff, and springy in the starching. Fashion is grown a monster!
pray tell your operator that your hair must measure just three quarters of a yard from the extremity of
one wing to the other.'</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> 'Eighteen years before the date of the investigation (February 1809), Mrs. Clarke, then being
about fourteen years of age, resided with her mother and step-father in Black Raven Passage,
Cursitor Street. She was a very pretty, sprightly, gaily-disposed girl, being very fond of showing
herself, and attracting attention. At this time Mr. Joseph Clarke, son of a respectable builder on
Snow Hill (his father was the "great contractor" of his day, and a <em>man reputed to be enormously rich</em>)
became enamoured of Miss Thompson, who readily received his addresses. She eloped with him, and
they lived together about three years, when he married her. She conducted herself with propriety,
and they lived together decently several years; in the course of which she bore him several children,
four of whom are alive.'&mdash;<cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>, February, 1809.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The name of Mrs. Clarke's father was Thompson, and he, it appears, was a master printer of
some respectability, residing in Bowl and Pin Alley, near White's Alley, Chancery Lane, where Miss
Thompson was ushered into the world, as Sterne has it, with 'squalls of disapprobation at the journey
she was compelled to perform.'
</p>
<p>
Upon the death of Mr. Thompson, his widow married a Mr. Farquhar, who was engaged as a
compositor in the printing house of Mr. Hughes. Miss Thompson was occasionally employed in
reading copy to the person engaged as corrector of the press, in which situation she soon attracted
the notice of the son of the overseer, who, recognising her abilities, had her placed at a boarding
school at Ham, where the young lady, whose 'capacity for elegant improvements' was, if we trust her
biographers, of an advanced order, soon acquired ornamental accomplishments; and, from the natural
quickness of her parts, she returned, after an absence of two years, so completely altered in her ideas
that she thought proper to despise and treat with coldness the attentions of Mr. Day, the well-meaning
young gentleman who had been at the charge of finishing her education, it is said, with the view to a
future union with this sprightly and promising female prodigy.
</p>
<p>
Her biographers have hinted at least one flirtation, possibly of a harmless description, before she
arrived at the age of seventeen, when she threw in her future with Mr. Joseph Clarke, the hopeful son
of a wealthy builder and contractor in Snow Hill. After a union of many years, during which she
had experienced various vicissitudes, we find that the misconduct of her husband, who seems, on the
whole&mdash;from the accounts of some of his contemporaries&mdash;to have done his best to deserve the
treatment he received, although there are two sides to this story, determined the fascinating Mary
Ann to trust to her own resources for support.

During her tenure of the 'neutral territory,' the name of more than one gentleman of gallant
reputation and of rank was coupled with her own; but passing over the list of her admirers, we must
mention a certain Mr. Dowler (whose name occurred frequently during the investigation), who seems
to have had more faithful regard for the lady than her other doubtful lights of love. Mrs. Clarke
further became ambitious of shining on a larger scale, and she had the honour of appearing on the
boards of the Haymarket Theatre in the character of Portia. Great praise was awarded her performance;
her natural abilities, with a certain vivacity, added to a well modulated voice and graceful
action, were sufficient to qualify her for a successful actress; but she felt that her proper stage was
the world, and she merely secured her introduction to the histrionic profession as an experiment
towards promoting the foundation of her future fortunes, and her object in this regard seems to have
been secured and her plans were successfully realised.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Colonel Wardle had promised, or clearly given it to be understood by Mrs. Clarke, that he
would furnish a house for her at Westbourne Place, in part payment for her services in the prosecution
of the Duke of York. Colonel Wardle, afterwards finding it convenient to deny that he had come
under any such obligation, was sued at law by an upholsterer who had furnished the house; and,
on the evidence of Mrs. Clarke and the upholsterer's brother, obliged to pay about 2000<i>l.</i>, with costs.
The day after judgment was given in this cause, Colonel Wardle published, in several newspapers, a
note addressed to the people of the three kingdoms, declaring before God and his country that a
verdict had been obtained against him only through perjury. During the progress of the trial, the
colonel had written to his men of law again and again, desiring that Major Dodd, Mr. James Glennie,
heretofore of the corps of engineers, and other respectable witnesses, should be examined; but the
lawyers thought this unnecessary. The evidence of Mrs. Clarke, and of the brother of the upholsterer,
on oath, would be overthrown by that of the respectable witnesses whom he had to bring forward on
a second trial for which he had made application. But if so, what is to be thought of the evidence of
Mrs. Clarke against the Duke of York?&mdash;<cite>Annual Register</cite>, 1809.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> March 23, 1809.&mdash;The Speaker put the question: 'That it is the opinion of this House that
General Clavering in the said evidence is guilty of prevarication,' which was agreed to without a
division; and General Clavering was ordered to be forthwith taken into the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms.
</p>
<p>
March 24.&mdash;The Serjeant-at-Arms, having reported that General Clavering was in custody, Mr.
W. Wynne moved, 'That, for his prevarication before the Committee of the whole House, General
Clavering be now committed to Newgate, and the speaker do issue his warrant accordingly;' which
was agreed to.

March 27.&mdash;Mr. Fane presented a petition from Captain Sandon, which, after stating his services
in the army for upwards of thirty years in various parts of the globe, concludes with apologising for
his conduct at the Bar of that House, by attributing it to the hardships he had recently undergone in
Spain, combined with an injury sustained on the brain some time since, and the novelty of his
situation when called on to give evidence.
</p>
<p>
March 28.&mdash;On the motion of Mr. Fane, Captain Huxley Sandon was called to the Bar; and,
after a very impressive reprimand from Mr. Speaker, was ordered to be discharged out of custody on
paying the fees.</p></div>

During the Parliamentary enquiry Mrs. Clarke appeared at the Bar of the House dressed in a
pelisse and skirt of light blue silk, trimmed with white fur, with a white muff, and wearing a hat and
veil of white, the latter turned up to show her face. Her features are described as more pleasing
than handsome, according to recognised standards of regular types of countenance. Her complexion
was remarkably clear and animated; and her eyes, which were blue, were large and full of light and
vivacity. She was somewhat small in stature, her figure was well turned; and as her arms were much
admired for their shapely form, she was partial to attitudes which showed them off to advantage.</p></div>

<h2>Transcriber's Notes:</h2>

<p>In the text version, footnotes have been moved to the end of each
chapter with the exception of a note in the summary table. In the html
version, footnotes have been moved to the end of the text.</p>

<p>Illustrations have been moved to paragragh breaks in a direction which
brings them closer to their descriptions. In the html version this has left blank pages
where page numbers are omitted.</p>

<p>Obvious typos and punctuation errors have been corrected, but In as
many cases as possible the original spelling is retained. It usually adds
to the general hilarity.</p>

<p>There are many instances of double choices for hyphenations. Some same
words are hyphenated and some aren't. These have been left as printed.</p>

<p>The names 'Billingsgatura', 'Billingsgatina' and 'Billingsgata' all seem to refer to the same print,
left as printed.</p>

<p>p.vii. 'An Essay on the Art of Ingeinously Tormenting'. Ingeinously
changed to Ingeniously.</p>

<p>p.127. 'The sale Room' changed to 'The Sale Room'.</p>

<p>p.141. The end of the sentence in the original text reads,'Commander-
in Chief'. The e-text will read all on the same line as,
Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>p.148. February 29, 1809. In 1809, February was not a leap year. This appears to be
a typo for February 25.</p>

to prod'.</p>
